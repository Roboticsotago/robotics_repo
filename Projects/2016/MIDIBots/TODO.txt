2016 Otago Regional event was a success!  We placed 1st in the Senior Theatre, yay! :)

National event is in Auckland on Saturday, September 10 (entries close Friday, August 26).  Some things to work on between now and then:

[ ] Test the spare PSUs (power supply units) in case they're needed
	Oh dear. One shuts down, the other blows up! :(
[Y] Make custom Molex power wiring?  See Power.txt

[ ] Double-check latency settings for the bots that need it

[ ] Check that the latest code compiles and runs correctly, and that it's all in the repository and pushed to github
	This will be very important if we have to make last-minute code changes at the event!

[ ] Sequence the music and lighting in Rosegarden!
	See Music.txt for suggestions for the medley
	[ ] Add triangle hit between We Will Rock You and Smoke on the Water, to mark the transition.
	[ ] Change chords at end of Trololo - maybe should be 
	[ ] Occasional percussion during Fuer Elise?
	[ ] Check latency (delay) setting for each segment. Parts for one channel might need to be split across multiple tracks or segments, e.g. for PercussionBot's shaker, which has more delay I think.
	[ ] Check which system timer is being used for Rosegarden's sequencer. The default 250 Hz one might be a bit coarse.

[Y] Refactor the firmware programs to use our MIDIBot library:
	[Y] UkeBot
	[Y] LightingBot
	[Y] PercussionBot
	[Y] DrumBot
	[Y] SynthBot

[ ] Tweak lighting on individual bots (placement, colour, fading)
	Maybe illuminated balloon idea? They look great using the 12 V LED modules from Jaycar
	SynthBot
	PercussionBot
	LightingBot?

[ ] Fix bug in conditionally-compiled code for the ATmega1280/2560 in programs that use custom PWM control (comma should be semicolon)
	We're only using one Mega (for FanBot) but just in case...
[ ] Also, the custom PWM code doesn't correctly handle a duty cycle of 0, it seems - on the oscilloscope on the FanBot firmware test, a setting of 0 still gives a narrow pulse.
	Try phase-correct PWM. See:
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23853066/how-to-achieve-zero-duty-cycle-pwm-in-avr-without-glitches

UkeBot:
	[Y] Cut off excess board behind tuning pegs for easier access.
	[N] Upgrade tuners to geared ones?  Maybe not worth the expense.  Also, with some force, they're more stable now.
	[Y] Reduce friction in slide guideway: reshape a little, rub wax into wood.
	[Y] Slide mechanism for UkeBot (stepper motor)
		In the end we used a servo motor and a linkage

DrumBot:
	[ ] Get a proper snare drum for DrumBot (or adapt existing one)?

PercussionBot:
	[Y] Troubleshoot PercussionBot
		The shield was not properly seated, and digital pins 10 and 11 do not work properly any more (tested on oscilloscope).  With a new Arduino board it seems OK.
		I think the old board is more fried than just those two pins - it's been getting very hot, both in the power circuits and the main microcontroller chip it seems. Better not use it!
	[ ] Fix backlash in triangle striker
	[ ] Fix resonance in triangle mount
	[ ] add rattle (DC motor - fan with blade striker?)
	[ ] Tweak latencies per instrument
	[Y] use alternating note numbers for shaker movement

LightingBot:
	[Y] Finalise firmware for LightingBot to include driving the RGB lighting strip(s), maybe look at MIDI CC messages
		Works fine with MIDI note messages; don't bother with MIDI CC for now.
	[Y] Laser-cut logo (Henry)

FanBot:
	[Y] Solder a wire onto the shield for 3.3 V supply for the BMP085 pressure sensor
	[N] Add break-out headers to the stripboard for the pressure sensor (already have ground, but will need 3.3 V supply, and SDA and SCL for I2C.  These will go to pins 20 and 21 on the Mega.
	[Y] Wire up stripboard breakout for the fan. There's no connection yet between the tach output and the Mega, but everything else (including pull-up resistor) is there.
	[Y] Solder on a wire from pin 12 on the shield, since that's the pin that's used for custom PWM on the Mega.  This is for fan speed control, which is supposed to be ~25 kHz.

[Y] Air reservoir system for woodwind instruments (learn about control systems in the process)
[ ] WhistleBot (slide whistle)
[ ] RecorderBot. With a taped-over thumb-hole and solenoid finger-hole valves on the first four holes, we can play the important bits of the melody from "We Will Rock You".
[ ] Harmonica? Bird Whistle? Pan Pipes?
[ ] Could extend music to include a medley of different music. Suggestions..?
	Uke can now play bits of the melody from Fuer Elise (perhaps duet with SynthBot)
	Smoke on the Water?
	Percussion section solo (funky beats, with lighting show)

Chris:
[N] Buy a set of Chinese Arduino clones
	No, we have enough if we use Paul Campbell's and use a Mega for the FanBot (in order to get access to the I2C pins).
