2016 Otago Regional event was a success!  We placed 1st in the Senior Theatre, yay! :)

National event is in Auckland on Saturday, September 10 (entries close Friday, August 26).  Some things to work on between now and then:

[ ] Refactor the firmware programs to use our MIDIBot library:
	[Y] UkeBot
	[Y] LightingBot
	[Y] PercussionBot
	[Y] DrumBot
	[Y] SynthBot
[ ] Tweak lighting on individual bots (placement, colour, fading)

UkeBot:
	[ ] Slide mechanism for UkeBot (stepper motor)

DrumBot:
	[ ] Get a proper snare drum for DrumBot (or adapt existing one)

PercussionBot:
	[Y] Troubleshoot PercussionBot
		The shield was not properly seated, and digital pins 10 and 11 do not work properly any more (tested on oscilloscope).  With a new Arduino board it seems OK.
	[ ] Fix backlash in triangle sriker
	[ ] PercussionBot: add rattle (DC motor)
	[ ] PercussionBot: use alternating note numbers for shaker movement

LightingBot:
	[Y] Finalise firmware for LightingBot to include driving the RGB lighting strip(s), maybe look at MIDI CC messages
		Works fine with MIDI note messages; don't bother with MIDI CC for now.
	[ ] Laser-cut logo

[ ] Make custom Molex power wiring?

[ ] Air reservoir system for woodwind instruments (learn about control systems in the process)
[ ] RecorderBot. With a taped-over thumb-hole and solenoid finger-hole valves on the first four holes, we can play the important bits of the melody from "We Will Rock You".
[ ] Harmonica? Bird Whistle? Pan Pipes?
[ ] Could extend music to include a medley of different music. Suggestions..?

Chris:
[ ] Buy a set of Chinese Arduino clones
