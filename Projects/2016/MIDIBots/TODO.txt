2016 Otago Regional event was a success!  We placed 1st in the Senior Theatre, yay! :)

National event is in Auckland on Saturday, September 10 (entries close Friday, August 26).  Some things to work on between now and then:

[Y] Refactor the firmware programs to use our MIDIBot library:
	[Y] UkeBot
	[Y] LightingBot
	[Y] PercussionBot
	[Y] DrumBot
	[Y] SynthBot

[ ] Tweak lighting on individual bots (placement, colour, fading)
	Maybe balloon idea? Especially if we can get some more of those 12 V LED modules from Jaycar

[ ] Test the spare PSUs (power supply units) in case they're needed

[ ] Fix bug in conditionally-copmiled code for the ATmega1280/2560 in programs that use custom PWM control (comma should be semicolon )
[ ] Also, the custom PWM code doesn't correctly handle a duty cycle of 0, it seems - on the oscilloscope on the FanBot firmware test, a setting of 0 still gives a narrow pulse.


UkeBot:
	[ ] Reduce friction in slide guideway: reshape a little, rub wax into wood.
	[ ] Cut off excess board behind tuning pegs for easier access.
	[ ] Upgrade tuners to geared ones?
	[Y] Slide mechanism for UkeBot (stepper motor)
		In the end we used a servo motor and a linkage

DrumBot:
	[ ] Get a proper snare drum for DrumBot (or adapt existing one)

PercussionBot:
	[Y] Troubleshoot PercussionBot
		The shield was not properly seated, and digital pins 10 and 11 do not work properly any more (tested on oscilloscope).  With a new Arduino board it seems OK.
	[ ] Fix backlash in triangle striker
	[ ] Fix resonance in triangle mount
	[ ] PercussionBot: add rattle (DC motor)
	[Y] PercussionBot: use alternating note numbers for shaker movement

LightingBot:
	[Y] Finalise firmware for LightingBot to include driving the RGB lighting strip(s), maybe look at MIDI CC messages
		Works fine with MIDI note messages; don't bother with MIDI CC for now.
	[ ] Laser-cut logo

FanBot:
	[ ] Solder a wire onto the shield for 3.3 V supply for the BMP085 pressure sensor
	[ ] Add break-out headers to the stripboard for the pressure sensor (already have ground, but will need 3.3 V supply, and SDA and SCL for I2C.  These will go to pins 20 and 21 on the Mega.
	[Y] Wire up stripboard breakout for the fan. There's no connection yet between the tach output and the Mega, but everything else (including pull-up resistor) is there.
	[Y] Solder on a wire from pin 12 on the shield, since that's the pin that's used for custom PWM on the Mega.  This is for fan speed control, which is supposed to be ~25 kHz.

[ ] Make custom Molex power wiring?

[ ] Air reservoir system for woodwind instruments (learn about control systems in the process)
[ ] WhistleBot (slide whistle)
[ ] RecorderBot. With a taped-over thumb-hole and solenoid finger-hole valves on the first four holes, we can play the important bits of the melody from "We Will Rock You".
[ ] Harmonica? Bird Whistle? Pan Pipes?
[ ] Could extend music to include a medley of different music. Suggestions..?
	Uke can now play bits of the melody from Fuer Elise (perhaps duet with SynthBot)
	Smoke on the Water?
	Percussion section solo (funky beats, with lighting show)

Chris:
[ ] Buy a set of Chinese Arduino clones
