Drum(s)
Cymbal
Triangle
Bell(s)
Castanets
Tambourine

Bird whistle
Recorder/flute
Slide whistle
Kazoo

Toy trumpet
Harmonica (mouth organ)
Toy piano
Melodica
Keytar
PWM synth
	-> could be played via Beldon's FM transmitter/receiver!
Ukulele

Now that we've got the Arduino shield design sussed, let's figure out which robots will play what, and using what actuators...

DrumBot:
	Servo 1: Bass drum
	Servo 2: Snare drum
	Servo 3: Cymbal
	MOSFET: light

PercussionBot:
	Servo 1: Shaker
	Servo 2: Woodblock
	Servo 3: Triangle
	MOSFET n: DC motor for football rattle
	+ lights?
	
UkeBot:
	tune to an open chord tuning

	Servo 1: Strumming/picking
	Stepper: Slide

RecorderBot:
	Will need air supply to be built!
	Tape over the thumb hole?

	Servo 1: air regulator
	MOSFETs: tone holes via solenoids
	also an air solenoid valve?  Or will the servo be able to cut it off completely and sharply enough?

SynthBot:
	use PWM to generate simple monophonic square waves (with variable duty)
	MOSFET on D6 (PWM): drive a speaker directly?  Add DC blocking capacitor to avoid damaging the speaker with DC?
	MOSFET: light

LightingBot:
	Servos 1-3: Use PWM to control Henry's RGB LED strip, via a suitable transistor circuit for each channel
	MOSFETs for other lights (one dimmable)
