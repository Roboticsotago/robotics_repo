KiCad and git...

https://contextualelectronics.com/learning/getting-started-with-github-and-kicad-hardware/

.pro	I think this is the main project file, containing links to the other files and general settings.
.sch	Schematic file?
.kicad_pcb	PCB layout file


Possible patterns for .gitignore:
<<
*.bak
*.bck
*.raw
*.log
*.dcm
*.kicad_pcb-bak
*autosave*
*cache*
>>

File types that definitely need to be in git repo:

.pro
.sch
.kicad_pcb
.net?
.cmp?
.lib?


How does git handle symbolic links?

The following libraries could not be found:

Downloads/dips-s

Documents/Settings/KiCAD/arduino-kicad-nicholasclewis/arduino_shieldsNCL

Documents/Settings/KiCAD/freetronics_kicad_library/freetronics_schematic

Documents/Settings/KiCAD/dips-s

So how to properly add libraries? Where to put them if the project is under git control?

Note that we probably need only one of the Arduino shield schematic libraries.  And only one of the dips-s libs.
arduino-kicad-nicholasclewis
freetronics_kicad_library

Maybe put them in the lib folder within the repo?

Arch packages:

sudo pacman -S kicad
"warning: downgrading package kicad (20130518-3 => 4.0.2-4)"?!

Plus libs from git:
yaourt -S kicad-library kicadlibrarian kicad-library-git kicad-pretty-git
