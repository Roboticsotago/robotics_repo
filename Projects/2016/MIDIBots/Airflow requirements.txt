Notes on airflow for the woodwind instruments for the MusicBots project 2016

--

We did some testing of Chris's Aerobed fan.  This is rated at 12 V ~6 A (10 A fuse), and is designed to be run off a car cigar lighter 
or eight 1.5 V batteries.

V-A testing off the bench supply:

V:	A:	Comment:
0	0
0.3	0.5
0.6	0.4	turn-off point
1.0	0.44	turn-on point
1.5	0.5
2.0	0.59
2.5	0.71
3.0	0.83
3.5	0.96
4.0	1.12
4.5	1.30
5.0	1.48
6.0	1.9
7.0	2.4
7.5	2.73
8.0	2.99	Power supply current limit

The fan/motor is quite noisy, even at low voltages.  I think the noise is mostly from the motor, not the fan impeller blades, so we 
might be able to replace it with a quieter brushless fan.  Alternatively, doing the 3D design and fabrication of an impeller will be 
good practice for the hovercraft project later in the year..!

For playing the recorder in tune, more pressure and airflow is required for higher notes.  Here is the voltage required to achieve the 
correct pitch (frequency) for some test notes:

D	1.9 V
E	2.1 V
G	2.5 V
A	2.7 V
B	3.1 V
C	3.2 V
D	3.4 V

Required air pressure for acoustic woodwind instruments:

oboe: 20..60 mm Hg = 2.8..7.7 kPa
Rossing: reed woodwind: 3-5 kPa
flute: ~1 kPa, 20..60 m/s air jet velocity

A centrifugal blower is probably a better type of fan for high pressure (axial fans can produce a lot of airflow, but are limited in 
pressure).

Centrifugal fan/impeller blades can be straight, or curved backwards or forwards.  Curved-forward centrifugal blades probably have the 
best characteristics:
 - high pressure
 - low noise
 - small airflow

They do require more mechanical power to run them, however.

Some candidiate fans (or we could make our own):

Sunon 12V:
	1.5 A @ 12 V
	5400 RPM
	44.2 CPM = 75 m^3/hour
	3.39 in. H2O = 0.84 kPa
	Probably not enough pressure

Sunon 3.5 A 12 V blower
	6800 RPM
	93 m^3/hour
	1.3 kPa
	Sufficient pressure for a recorder or flute, but probably not a reed instrument.

Fan speed control/pressure regulation

We will probably need some kind of air reservoir to help maintain steady pressure and airflow while mutliple woodwind instruments are 
turning on and off.  The regulation of air pressure could be done mechanically, using a weight or a spring mechanism, but we also have 
the opportunity to use an active control system by monitoring the pressure in the reservoir electronically, and using PWM to vary the 
fan motor speed.  It might be necessary to use a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control system to maintain the pressure 
accurately enough.

Note how airflow and pressure are analogous to electrical current and voltage!  The wind reservoir is like a capacitor.  A narrow tube 
is like a resistor (it will reduce the current and the pressure coming out).  Acoustic impedance (analogous to electrical impedance) is 
an important characteristic of air-column instruments such as brass and woodwind.
