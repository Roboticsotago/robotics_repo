Notes on airflow for the woodwind instruments for the MusicBots project 2016

--

We did some testing of Chris's Aerobed fan.  This is rated at 12 V ~6 A (10 A fuse), and is designed to be run off a car cigar lighter 
or eight 1.5 V batteries.

V-A testing off the bench supply:

V:	A:	Comment:
0	0
0.3	0.5
0.6	0.4	turn-off point
1.0	0.44	turn-on point
1.5	0.5
2.0	0.59
2.5	0.71
3.0	0.83
3.5	0.96
4.0	1.12
4.5	1.30
5.0	1.48
6.0	1.9
7.0	2.4
7.5	2.73
8.0	2.99	Power supply current limit

The fan/motor is quite noisy, even at low voltages.  I think the noise is mostly from the motor, not the fan impeller blades, so we 
might be able to replace it with a quieter brushless fan.  Alternatively, doing the 3D design and fabrication of an impeller will be 
good practice for the hovercraft project later in the year..!

For playing the recorder in tune, more pressure and airflow is required for higher notes.  Here is the voltage required to achieve the 
correct pitch (frequency) for some test notes:

D	1.9 V
E	2.1 V
G	2.5 V
A	2.7 V
B	3.1 V
C	3.2 V
D	3.4 V

Required air pressure for acoustic woodwind instruments:

oboe: 20..60 mm Hg = 2.8..7.7 kPa
Rossing: reed woodwind: 3-5 kPa
flute: ~1 kPa, 20..60 m/s air jet velocity

Fuks and Sundberg (1996):
	Clarinet: 25-60 cm H2O -> 2.5-6.0 kPa
	Saxophone: 15-80 cm H2O -> 1.5-8.0 kPa
	Oboe: 35-100 cm H2O -> 3.5-10.0 kPa
	Bassoon: 10-90 cm H2O -> 1.0-9.0 kPa

Fletcher:
	Flute: 0.2-2.5 kPa

A centrifugal blower is probably a better type of fan for high pressure (axial fans can produce a lot of airflow, but are limited in 
pressure).

Centrifugal fan/impeller blades can be straight, or curved backwards or forwards.  Curved-forward centrifugal blades probably have the 
best characteristics:
 - high pressure
 - low noise
 - small airflow

They do require more mechanical power to run them, however.

Some candidiate fans (or we could make our own):

Sunon 12V:
	1.5 A @ 12 V
	5400 RPM
	44.2 CPM = 75 m^3/hour
	3.39 in. H2O = 0.84 kPa
	Probably not enough pressure

Sunon 3.5 A 12 V blower, PF97331BX-B00U-A99
	97 mm x 95 mm x 33 mm
	6800 RPM
	93 m^3/hour
	1.3 kPa
	Sufficient pressure for a recorder or flute, but probably not a reed instrument.
	Digi-Key has, but only in min. 30x orders
	
Delta-Electronics BCB1012UH-F00
	1.0 kPa
	9300 RPM
	1.00 m^3/min
	3 wire leads

Delta-Electronics BCB0812UHN-TP09
	0.915 kPa
	2.3 A
	PWM control and tach! (4-wire)
	http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/delta-electronics/BCB0812UHN-TP09/603-1213-ND/2034820
	Could use with plain Arduino (no shield required) - with pressure sensor for control feedback
		Have ordered one of these from Digi-Key

Fan speed control/pressure regulation

We will probably need some kind of air reservoir to help maintain steady pressure and airflow while mutliple woodwind instruments are 
turning on and off.  The regulation of air pressure could be done mechanically, using a weight or a spring mechanism, but we also have 
the opportunity to use an active control system by monitoring the pressure in the reservoir electronically, and using PWM to vary the 
fan motor speed.  It might be necessary to use a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control system to maintain the pressure 
accurately enough.

Note how airflow and pressure are analogous to electrical current and voltage!  The wind reservoir is like a capacitor.  A narrow tube 
is like a resistor (it will reduce the current and the pressure coming out).  Acoustic impedance (analogous to electrical impedance) is 
an important characteristic of air-column instruments such as brass and woodwind.

We will also want to be able to regulate the pressure/flow at the instrument in order to get acceptable intonation. We have tested an 
arrangement using a servo motor squeezing on a thin air tube made from heatshrink tubing.  The Hitec servos seem to be strong enough for 
this application.  If this can cut off the air supply completely, then we would not require a separate solenoid valve.  An alternative 
to the squeezed tube would be a butterfly valve: a disc-shaped valve rotating inside a cylindrical pipe.  This would be a good match for 
a servo motor, and would probably be easier to actuate as the airflow is roughly balanced on both sides of the valve (having to work 
against the airflow would require more force).
