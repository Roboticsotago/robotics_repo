General specifications:
	Pneumatic (suitable for air)
	Direct-acting
	Normally Closed (NC)
	12 V DC operation
	Suitable for 1-2 kPa air pressure (< 1 PSI): "Low Pressure" or even "Ultra Low Pressure"
		Ideally will open with no pressure, or merely tens of Pa
	What fitting diameter/thread?  Screw-in hose fittings?  G or NPT?

Air jet velocities of a under 20 m/s (a few tens of m/s according to Fletcher)

Proportional one for the recorder and slide whistle, allowing local control of pressure?


Air horn valve, maybe?  Aquarium pump supply store?  Dishwasher drain valve?  Garden supply?  Ask Donald?


200 PSI is about 1.4 MPa
We're only dealing with a couple of kPa


1/4"	6.35 mm
1/2" 	12.7 mm (prefer)

Flow capacity, flow value?  Cv?  Flow factor?  Acoustic impedance?

Cv (flow coefficient) is an important specification for a valve.  Any valve will incur a certain pressure drop.  Since we're dealing with such low pressures to begin with, we want valves with minimal "resistance", and therefore a ??HIGH/LOW?? flow capacity constant.

Metric equivalent is flow factor:

Kv = Q / sqrt[dP]

	Kv = flow factor (m^3/hour)
	Q = flow rate (m^3/hour)
	dP = pressure difference across device (bar)

Can determine flow rate Q from jet velocity by multiplying by cross-sectional area?

Let's guesstimate 1.5 mm * 10 mm = 15 mm^2 area for recorder mouthpiece.

15 mm^2 * 15 m/s -> m^3/hour
81/100 (exactly 0.81)

We probably don't want the valve to drop more than a few hundred Pa (the fan can theoretically supply about 1 kPa, but there will be other losses and we don't want to have to run it at full speed).

Let's say 1 m^3/hour, 100 Pa (0.001 bar) drop:

Kv = (1 m^3/hour) / sqrt[0.001 bar]

Kv = 32

I don't think that's right...

Let's try again:

Q = 15 mm^2 * 15 m/s -> m^3/hour
dP = 600 Pa - 250 Pa -> bar
Kv = 0.81 / sqrt[0.0035]
   = 13.7

That seems more reasonable.

To convert to Cv:

Cv = Kv / 0.865

Cv = ~16

gave me a Cv of only 0.7
hmm

Inlet pressure say 600 Pa = 0.006 bar
That's off the bottom of the scale. :(

Cv = 12-20?

That's a pretty high value. :(  Might have to consider another approach.

Note that higher values of Cv indicate less resistance, i.e. more desirable.

Acoustic impedance, Zp, is acoustic pressure / acoustic volume flow, analogous to resistance in Ohm's law (R = V/I)

Candidate devices:

Dammit, neither AdaFruit nor SparkFun seem to stock the low-pressure drainage version any more..

Model: USS2-00005 maybe?

Valco 2/2 Y-Type low pressure LDO type?
