Robotics 2016-05-16 Lesson Plan

We need to finalise the circuit and PCB designs for the Arduino MIDI shields pretty soon!

Things to test:

[ ] The number of servo motors usable with the Servo library
[ ] Which Arduino pins work reliably with the Servo library
	It seems it's not just the PWM ones - pin D9 didn't work last time!
[ ] Current draw for different servos at 5 V (we have 12 and 5 V lines with an ATX PC PSU)
	Hobby servo motors are nominally 4.8 V, or 6 V, or sometimes higher.  5 V is probably OK.
[ ] Voltage spikes using solenoids - 
[ ] How to supply +12 V and +5 V to the board.
	Maybe use a Molex connector?
	If the board only needs 12 V we could use the barrel jack on the Arduino mainboard

If we have time: a lesson in Pure Data (Pd)

[ ] Get from http://www.puredata.info/
[ ] Build a simple controllable oscillator
[ ] Add a volume control
[ ] Arduino serial input (with light sensor) - Theremin!
[ ] Look at MIDI processing?  Esp. per-channel delays for the MusicBots.
