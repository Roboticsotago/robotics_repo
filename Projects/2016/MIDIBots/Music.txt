Tune ukulele to A-D-D-A?  A-D-F#-B?

We Will Rock You (Queen, 1977), 81 BPM, about 0:35
	DrumBot intro
	SynthBot for vocal melody
	PercussionBot too?
	UkeBot?
	Actions: stomp and clap as at regionals
	Originally in E

Smoke on the Water (Deep Purple, 1972), 112 BPM, about 0:35
	UkeBot sliding chords, solo intro
	PercussionBot could provide the hihat effect using the shaker
	DrumBot joins in with snare and then full drumbeat
	SynthBot then provides the bass
	Probably abbreviate a little from the original: 1x Uke, 1x with shaker and snare, then 2x with full drums and synth bass
	Actions: air guitar?
	Would sound good in A if Rock You was in E, but pretty much has to be in open uke key, i.e. D

"Fuer Elise" (Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor, Beethoven, 1810), also about 0:35!
	UkeBot could play a simplified version of the melody
	SynthBot could play the accompaniment and fill in notes that UkeBot can't reach
	perhaps just a 30-second snippet, with the well-known A/B/A section
	Actions: ballet dance with pirouettes? This is a popular tune for music boxes.
	A in the original has to map to open uke note
	Slide positions are programmed with C being the lowest note, so transpose up 3 semitones from the original.

A percussion solo?  Could also showcase LightingBot in sync.
	Actions: air drums

A finale?  Some sort of punchline might be nice, like the single cymbal crash at the end of the regional performance.

Trololo song?
