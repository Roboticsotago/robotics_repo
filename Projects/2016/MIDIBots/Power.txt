Beldon's PC power supply unit has four Molex connectors, so we will need both splitters and extender cables to power all the bots!

PSU
	cable
		Molex

We have the following bots to power:
	SynthBot
	DrumBot
	PercussionBot
	UkeBot
	LightingBot
	FanBot
	WhistleBot
	and possibly another woodwind bot if we get time

So let's say 8 bots to be powered...

So, would need 4 splitters and 8 extension cables.

Or, maybe we can place the bots close enough together that the splitters could connect to two adjacent robots.  Then we'd only need 4 extension cables, and would use the following arrangement:

PSU
	cable
		Molex
			extension
				splitter
					
		Molex
			extension
				splitter
					
	cable
		Molex
			extension
				splitter
		Molex
			extension
				splitter


We currently have:
	1 extender
	1 extender-plus-splitter.
	3 splitters

We could use terminal blocks to quickly fasten together additional cabling as required.

Probably need to pick up some wire from Jaycar...
	18 AWG is generally what's used
	20 AWG (thinner) on some of the splitters, though
	2U black to 1U red and 1U yellow.

Jaycar shopping:
[ ] 1 x PL0750 Molex splitter
[ ] screw terminal strip block - maybe 10 A
[ ] 18 AWG wire

Or maybe Chris has some more spares at home that will suffice.  We could possibly  cut off some of the SATA power connectors from the power supply if required.
