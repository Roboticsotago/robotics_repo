Channel Mappings for the 2016 Robot Orchestra

Note that the Freetronics USBDroid boards have extra pull-down resistors on several pins, including the 4x multiplier bit for the MIDI channel DIP switches, so not all MIDI channels can be set.

TODO: also make not of which MIDI note numbers have special functions for each bot, e.g. notes that correspond to lights on LightingBot.
