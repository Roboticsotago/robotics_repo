Special connector types:
 - keyed SIL PCB headers for the MIDI IN and THRU (2- or 3-pin? tie shield ground to chassis or PCB ground?)
 - keyed 3-pin PCB headers for the servo motors
 - 4-pin PC-style "Molex" (actually AMP) connector for power (+12V, +5V, GND)
 
PCB header connectors with keying (like wot you could get from Dick Smith, and can still from Jaycar)
	These are the type that have been used for PC motherboard fan headers for like forever.
	2.54 mm pitch, JYK crimp, Molex KK, 
	
For the servos:
	JST SH or JR? Hansen Hobbies say JR as well. JR/Spektrum/Uni
	JST ZHR? No, that's the tiny one used on micro servos.
	0.1" spacing, 22 AWG cable (as a guide to PCB track width)
	0.1" spacing confirmed by BRC hobbies (JR connector)

		Futaba J connector is 0.1" pitch and has keying
		JR connector is very similar but lacks the keying

	Sigh, could just use ordinary 0.1" header pins and be careful with orientation when plugging in (include orientation guide in the silkscreening!)
	
	NOTE: JST RCY is the 2-pole type used often for power connectors.


Power connector is an AMP MATE-N-LOK (not Molex, haha), 11 A per pin
	1: +12v (yellow)
	2: GND (black)
	3: GND (black)
	4: +5V (red)
	
	DSpace Robot uses part 9090-4V
