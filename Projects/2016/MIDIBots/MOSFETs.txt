Some notes on using MOSFETs as electronic switches for Roboclass 2016

High-side vs low-side switching:

Important characteristics:
 - Rds(on): this is the resistance between drain and source when the device is "on". This determines the amount of current it can supply at a given voltage and load, and also how much heat will be dissipated. You might need a heat sink!
 - Maximum drain-source voltage: this determines the 
 - Vgs(th): the "on" threshold in terms of gate-to-source voltage
 - Vhtresh: the "off" threshold. This should be under 1 V for a logic-compatible device.
 - Maximum drain-source current
 - Gate capacitance. One characteristic of FETs is that the gate has sometimes significant capacitance, so can draw a brief but significant current when being charged/discharged.  A resistor to limit this gate current might be necessary.  Large FETs may require additional circuitry to drive the gate promptly (in order to supply sufficient current at a high enough voltage).

Many FETs require considerable gate-source voltages to turn on fully, sometimes 10 V or more.

Some recommended MOSFETs that are compatible with logic levels:
IRL540
IRLZ44
F12N10L
	N-channel logic-level power MOSFET
	100 V, 12 A, 200 mOhm
	integrated protection diode
	I bought a bunch of these for Roboclass a couple of years ago
FQP30N06L
	N-channel MOSFET, 60 V, 30 A
RFP30N06LE
	Used interchangeably with the FQP30N06L (SparkFun vary between stocking both as the same item)
FDC855N
	SMT
STP55NF06L
	SMT, used in the RAMPS design
PSMN7R0-60YS
	SMT, used in RAMBo design for the heater outputs
IRLM6346TRPBF
	SMT, used in RAMBo design for the fan outputs

Might be sensible to just use the MOSFET output design from the RAMPS/RAMBo.  These use low-side MOSFET switching, a 10-ohm gate series resistor, a 100k gate resistor to ground, an LED and series 1k resistor in parallel with the load.

Other considerations:
 - opto-isolation
 - test points
 - plenty of grounds!

Protection and power quality:
 - fuses
 - diodes (at power input, across load, across FET?)
 - capacitors

Also, I might get sucked in to thinking about building my own electronic CAD tools...starting with a relational database model for circuit networks.  Could we potentially use graphviz or something to produce diagrams?

Things in the model:
 - component/device types (including things like connectors, antennas, etc.)
 - physical footprints (e.g. IC pin assignments, connector pin-outs, physical dimensions, silkscreening, maybe 3D model)
 - 
 - schematics and sub-schematics/modules
 - PCB layouts (including various layers)
 - Projects
 - Alternatives? Variations? History? Version control?
