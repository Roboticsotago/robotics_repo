Will definitely need to use the 10 cm x 10 cm maximum board size!

Essential layers and filename requirements (see also Ian's talk at Makerspace from early 2016):
 - In Pcbnew's Plot dialog, check the "Use Protel filename extensions". This will set most correctly.
 - It's possibly a good idea to include the edge layers on all the output files (or not???)
 - Rename Edge.Cuts file (.gm1 to .gml)


Ext.:		KiCad:		Description:
GTO		F.SilkS		Top Silkscreen (text)
GTS		F.Mask		Top Soldermask (the 'green' stuff)
GTL		F.Cu		Top Copper (conducting layer)
GBL		B.Cu		Bottom Copper
GBS		B.Mask		Bottom Soldermask
GBO		B.SilkS		Bottom Silkscreen
GML/GKO/GBR*	Edge.Cuts	Board Outline* <-- REQUIRED
TXT				Routing and Drill (the holes and slots)

Archive all the files into a Zip file.

I get the following files:
	.gtl
	.gbl
	.gbs
	.gbo
	.gm1
	.gts
	.gto

They have the base filename with the KiCAD layer names added, e.g. MIDI_Shield-F.Mask.gts

Might as well have a script to bundle them all up:

<<
#!/bin/sh
BASENAME=MIDI_Shield
ls $BASENAME{.gto,.gts,.gtl,.gbl,.gbs,.gbo,.gml,.txt}

mv $BASENAME.drl $BASENAME.txt
mv $BASENAME.gm1 $BASENAME.gml
zip ... TODO
>>

Questions for Paul and Ian:

 - Where should the origin be?  Top-left corner?  Centre of board?  Does it matter that the board is currently offset from the top-left corner by several cm?
 
 - Drills and vias: so many settings, I didn't change anything! Is that OK?
 
 - Do they want the edge cuts layer to appear in all Gerbers, or just the one?

 - Should the .zip file contain a top-level folder?
