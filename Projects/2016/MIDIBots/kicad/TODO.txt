[ ] Tidy up +12V trace supplying the Arduino VIN.
[ ] Move the MOSFET output flyback diodes to the other side of the connector and LED, for tidier layout?

[ ] Add some more net labels to assist with assigning track styles on PCB.
[ ] Filter and bypass caps as part of each MOSFET circuit? Think DC motor, solenoid, lamp, etc.
[ ] Tidy up silkscreen (remove old Arduino border?)
[ ] Check for conflict with big USB-B on some Arduino boards
[ ] Remove mounting holes in board?
[ ] Board outline cuts
[ ] Decorative text, logo

--
[Y] Move LAT_ADJ label so it won't be covered by the PC900V IC socket
[Y] Move the servo headers to the left a little
[Y] Label SW2 as CH or MIDI_CH
[Y] Corrected layout orientation of input diode D1
[Y] Moved some part reference labels to be visible
--
[Y] Added Current_Loop track style
[Y] Assigned some more track styles and ran a few additional tracks
--
[Y] Remap pins for MOSFET 3 and 4 to make PCB routing easier
[Y] Break out remaining Arduino pins (there's only about 2!) and put header with a GND in the bottom left corner.
[Y] Fixed unexpected mess with use of old DIP socket footprints
[Y] Various footprints remapped
--
[Y] Flip resistors around MOSFET circuits and reroute tracks
[Y] Add 12V aux track
[Y] Route VCC tracks/zones
[Y] Fixed some unconnected track segments
[Y] Moved some reference labels
[Y] Finalise outline and add ground plane!
--
[Y] Fix weird grounding layout on the decoupling cap on the PC900V.
--
[Y] Remove shield silkscreening to allow more legible text.
[Y] Remove stray "P3" from back silkscreening.
--
[Y] Remove 10 cm x 10 cm alignment markers (in case they will be unwanted)
--
[Y] Move entire board to be nearer the origin (in case that's important for keeping within the size limit)? Or set origin, if that's possible. Paul says the origin should be at the bottom-left of the board.  There is also a "Use auxiliary axis as origin" option when plotting to Gerber - relevant?  Seems so.  Oh, don't forget to do the same with the drill settings!
[Y] Add copyright information and tidy up notice
