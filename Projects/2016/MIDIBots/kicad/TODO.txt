[ ] Break out remaining Arduino pins (there's only about 2!) and put header with a GND in the bottom left corner.
[ ] Add some more net labels to assist with assigning track styles on PCB.
[ ] Filter and bypass caps as part of each MOSFET circuit? Think DC motor, solenoid, lamp, etc.
[ ] Tidy up silkscreen (remove old Arduino border?)
[ ] Check for conflict with big USB-B on some Arduino boards
[ ] Remove mounting holes in board?
[ ] Board outline cuts
[ ] Decorative text, logo
