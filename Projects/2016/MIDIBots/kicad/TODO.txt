[ ] Move entire board to be nearer the origin (in case that's important for keeping within the size limit)


[ ] Add some more net labels to assist with assigning track styles on PCB.
[ ] Filter and bypass caps as part of each MOSFET circuit? Think DC motor, solenoid, lamp, etc.
[ ] Tidy up silkscreen (remove old Arduino border?)
[ ] Check for conflict with big USB-B on some Arduino boards
[ ] Remove mounting holes in board?
[ ] Board outline cuts
[ ] Decorative text, logo

--
[Y] Move LAT_ADJ label so it won't be covered by the PC900V IC socket
[Y] Move the servo headers to the left a little
[Y] Label SW2 as CH or MIDI_CH
[Y] Corrected layout orientation of input diode D1
[Y] Moved some part reference labels to be visible
--
[Y] Added Current_Loop track style
[Y] Assigned some more track styles and ran a few additional tracks
--
[Y] Remap pins for MOSFET 3 and 4 to make PCB routing easier
[Y] Break out remaining Arduino pins (there's only about 2!) and put header with a GND in the bottom left corner.
[Y] Fixed unexpected mess with use of old DIP socket footprints
[Y] Various footprints remapped
--
[Y] Flip resistors around MOSFET circuits and reroute tracks
[Y] Add 12V aux track

[Y] Fix weird grounding layout on the decoupling cap on the PC900V.
--
[Y] Remove shield silkscreening to allow more legible text.
[Y] Remove stray "P3" from back silkscreening.
--
[Y] Remove 10 cm x 10 cm alignment markers (in case they will be unwanted)
