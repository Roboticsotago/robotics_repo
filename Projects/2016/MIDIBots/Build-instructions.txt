Some instructions and notes for building the Arduino MIDI shield boards for Robocup 2016


Start with the shortest parts, and work your way up. This helps avoid the nuisance of parts falling out when you flip the board over for soldering.

Resistors: there are a variety of these, but all low-power.
	10R: one in each MOSFET circuit
	100k: one in each MOSFET circuit
	1.8K: one in each MOSFET circuit, plus one for the +12V supply
	220R: one on MIDI_IN and two on MIDI_THRU
	330R: pin D13 LED, +5V supply LED


The current-limiting resistors for diodes are mostly 330 ohm, but those on the 12 V supply are 1.8k.

Diodes (watch the polarity!) are almost all 1N4007 parts:
	One per MOSFET output (4 total), pointing outwards
	Two in the power input circuit
	A 1N914 in the MIDI input circuit

4.5 mm: IC sockets for the 6-pin PC900V and the 14-pin. Watch the orientation!  Pin 1 has a square pad, and that end is also marked with a "U" shape.

5.5 mm: LEDs next, again watch the polarity!  The footprints are for 3 mm parts but you can probably fit 5 mm ones if you want.
	I suggest using two green ones in the power supply LEDs
	A yellow or orange one for each MOSFET output to indicate activity.  I like to reserve red for error warnings.
	There's also D2 near the top right (this connects to Arduino pin D13)..whatever colour you like!

6.5 mm: Decoupling capacitors (little blue "104" marked ones). Non-polarised. 5 per board, I think.

DIP switches for setting the MIDI input channel using binary.


8 mm: Plain pin headers:
	Three 1x3 headers for the servo outputs
	Two 1x2 headers for analog 3 and 4 output (or general use)

11.5 mm: Polarised SIL headers:
	A single 1x3 for the latency adjustment pot (chassis-mounted off-board)
	1x2 headers for the four auxiliary power outputs, the four MOSFET outputs, MIDI IN, MIDI THRU, and stepper motor header.

12 mm: Filter capacitors: watch the polarity!

MOSFET parts (TO-220, vertically installed).
	Watch the polarity!
	They should all face the same way, with pin 1 at the top.
	
Lastly, the strips of header pins for mounting the shield on the main Arduino board.
	You might even wish to try the combo pin/socket headers (I don't know if they'll fit).
	Tip: mount the headers and the shield on a real Arduino to hold everything in place while soldering.
