Pure Data: problems with [midiout]

Does it only affect alsa_seq output?

Is it a 64-bit problem?

Does the problem lie with [midiout] or [seq]?  How would we test this?


Use the source, Luke...

Here's where midiout is defined:

src/x_midi.c:    midiout_class = class_new(gensym("midiout"), (t_newmethod)midiout_new, 0,

sys_putmidibyte()
