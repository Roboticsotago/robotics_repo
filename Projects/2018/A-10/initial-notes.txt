RC A-10 plane build
Friday robotics, late 2018

Some nice things about the A-10:
 - It's a real plane
 - It looks mean
 - It's a low-speed jet, so...
 - Ducted fans (protected blades, protected fingers)
 - Straight wings, with some dihedral
 - Also, the fans are mounted rear and high, which should protect them in the event of a crash


How much thrust might it need?  How heavy will it be?  How much lift?

How much 

Smaller ones are designed for 2-cell batteries, larger ones for 3- or 4-cell batteries

Some common thrust ratings for EDF units:

2 pounds force (9 N), 50 mm fan
12 pounds force (53 N), 127 mm

30-50,000 RPM?!?!?! Yikes - very dangerous.

What scale would that make the plane, then?
	GE TF-34 engine
		1.23 m diameter -> 1/24.6 scale for 50 mm fan

What about scale speed?
	300 kts is pretty typical

Ducting characteristics: inlet cowling, flaring/tapering? Retain the engine core duct at rear for appearance?
