solve in under two minutes
requires no more than 30 moves to solve
size estimate: 30cm x 30cm x 30cm
core needs to include microcontroller + 6 motors
~2 seconds per move
~30rpm
gear ratio of 300:1
one move is a 90degree turn of one side
it is possible to move two opposite sides at the same time

Motors:
	stepper motors would be a convenient way to precisely control the rotation of each face. 
	NEMA 08 is (possibly) the smallest in the series
	NEMA 11 is the next largest
	NEMA 14 is the next largest
	NEMA 17 is the next largest (common on 3D printers)
	
	RepRap-style NEMA 17 motors can reasonably reach 400 RPM while providing reasonable torque.  By 600 RPM, many motors will have very little torque - possibly not enough to turn with no load!
