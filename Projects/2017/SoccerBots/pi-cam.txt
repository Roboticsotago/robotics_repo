Many docs online suggest using the userspace video4linux infrastructure (uv4l)

sudo nano /etc/uv4l/uv4l-raspicam.conf
sudo service uv4l_raspicam restart


Initial testing (using uv4l and default raspicam settings) seemed to work.

Then I tried overriding some defaults for better frame clarity and got this in simplecv:

HIGHGUI ERROR: V4L: Could not SYNC to video stream. Transport endpoint is not connected

"I fixed this by installing: libv4l-dev then recompiling opencv. Check your cmake output to make sure that V4L is actually being linked in properly."

However, recent versions of Raspbian apparently have a native V4L driver for the pi-cam:

# Need to disable the uv4l command at system startup too...

sudo systemctl disable uv4l_raspicam.service
sudo service uv4l_raspicam stop
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2

It works with simplecv, though the latency is quite poor, and now I have no idea how to set up the camera settings...

This looks promising:

v4l-ctl -l
v4l-ctl -c iso_sensitivity=0..4

# Sanity check:
v4l-ctl -c vertical_flip=1
# OK, that definitely does work then...and changes take effect immediately, even while simplecv is displaying the live feed.
power_line_frequency=1
	1 = 50 Hz
auto_exposure=1
	1 = Manual(!)
exposure_time_absolute=100
	< 100 gives mains power interference
white_balance_auto_preset=3
	0 = Manual
	3,4 = Fluorescent
iso_sensitivity_auto=0
iso_sensitivity=4
scene_mode=0
	11 = Sports
	
v4l2-ctl -c power_line_frequency=1 -c auto_exposure=1 -c exposure_time_absolute=100 -c  white_balance_auto_preset=3 -c iso_sensitivity=4 -c scene_mode=0
