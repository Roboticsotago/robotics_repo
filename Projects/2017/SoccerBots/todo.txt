Things to be done for the 2017 SoccerBots project

Software:

[ ] Define a DEBUG function or macro for Arduino programs
[ ] Robot control behaviour (in Pd)
[ ] Arrange for program to launch when Raspberry Pi boots
	Pd startup: pd -noaudio -nomidi patch-filename.pd

IR system:

[ ] Implement trigonometry stuff for ball direction finding (use atan2() function)
[ ] Calibrate IR ball distance sensing (want to determine approx. distance based on magnitude of the ball sense vector)
	Will probably need to talk about what a vector is and how you can use and combine them. :)

	To pipe input from serial:
	cu -l ttyUSB0 -s 9600
	
	To pipe a text stream (in FUDI format) into Pd:
	pdsend 7000
	
	Combining the two using a shell pipeline:
	cu -l ttyUSB0 -s 9600 | pdsend 7000


Vision system:

[ ] refine debug function for debug levels

[ ] fix white balance bug when click off image


General:

[Y] Design and implement serial protocol for motor control


Hardware:

[Y] Design and fab main robot platform (3D print? lasercut?)

[ ] Implement servo mechanism for wheels? Optical? Hall sensor?

[.] Design and test kicker mechanism. Servo? Maybe a high-speed one from Pololu.

[ ] Trial using a DSpace Robot board for motor and servo control (rather than separate Arduino + H-bridge)

[ ] Motor Enable switch (just a software switch for the DSpace board)

[ ] Build a power+ground bus board (screw terminals for input, header pins for multiple outputs)

[ ] Main power switch (to save having to disconnect the battery when not in use!)

[?] Add buzzer, and use it to warn of low voltage as reported by the DC-DC converter

[?] Maybe add lights? Just decorative? Must not confuse other robots!

[ ] Build second robot as Goalie.

[ ] Apply threadlocker (e.g. Loctite) to fasteners before competition

[ ] Build IR sensors for ball detection

[ ] Compass sensor (Sebastian and Tobias have been working on this)

[ ] Colour sensors for approximate location on the field
