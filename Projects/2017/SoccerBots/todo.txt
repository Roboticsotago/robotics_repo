Things to be done for the 2017 SoccerBots project

Vision system:

[ ] refine debug function for debug levels

[ ] fix white balance bug when click off image


General:

[Y] Design and implement serial protocol for motor control


Hardware:

[ ] Design and fab main robot platform (3D print? lasercut?)

[ ] Implement servo mechanism for wheels? Optical? Hall sensor?

[ ] Design and test kicker mechanism. Servo? Maybe a high-speed one from Pololu.

[ ] Trial using a DSpace Robot board for motor and servo control (rather than separate Arduino + H-bridge)

[ ] Build a power+ground bus board (screw terminals for input, header pins for multiple outputs)

[ ] Add buzzer, and use it to warn of low voltage as reported by the DC-DC converter

[ ] Maybe add lights? Just decorative? Must not confuse other robots!

[ ] Build second robot as Goalie.

[ ] Apply threadlocker (e.g. Loctite) to fasteners before competition

[ ] Build IR sensors for ball detection

[ ] Compass sensor

[ ] Colour sensors for approximate location on the field
