The typical "electronic compass" is really a three-axis magnetometer - a device that can measure magnetic field strength (and orientation?) in multiple axes.

Here's an example, based around the HMC5883L:

Magnetism generally, south and north conventions, the Earth's magnetic field

	Red = North
	White = South

	Earth's "north" pole is actually magnetically the south pole!  The north-pointing pole on a compass is truly a north magnetic pole.

	Experiment: determining polarity of an unknown magnet, given that we know which way (roughly) is north.

Magnetic North vs True North
	Not important for robot soccer

Orientation based on magnetic field
	Will need initial calibration..might be handy to have a straight edge on the robot so it can be placed against the wall of the soccer field.
	Recalibrate when changing sides!
	Note: limit of accuracy about 2 degrees with the HMC5883L. Might be good to combine readings probabilistically with input from the vision system.
