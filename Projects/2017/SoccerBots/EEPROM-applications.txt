EEPROM use for the SoccerBots

We can probably use the Arduino EEPROM memory to store robot-specific settings independently of the Arduino code.  This way, we don't need special versions of the code for the goalie and attacker (requiring separate files or "#ifdef"s), and can use one program for both.

Here are some possibilities:

 - Magnetometer calibration settings ({X,Y,Z} x {min, max})
 - Motor PWM limits (min as well as max?) for the left and right drivetrains.
 - Servo midpoint, max, min for different kickers

Before modifying the code, read the handout on Arduino memory types, and design a memory map for each Arduino type (DSpace motor controller, Mega-based sensor reader).  Remember that int values (signed or unsigned) will require two bytes.  A spreadsheet will help you avoid problems:

 Address | Variable  | Length (bytes) 
---------+-----------+----------------
       0 | L_PWM_MIN | 1
       1 | R_PWM_MAX | 1
       2 | L_PWM_MIN | 1
     ... |    ...    | ...
       
...where the address values are calculated using the address and length of the previous line.
