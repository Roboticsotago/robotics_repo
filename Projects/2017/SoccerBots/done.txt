Thought it might be useful to document things that have been improved upon since the regionals:

 - Wider-track chassis, allowing lower gear ratio for more reliable and controllable motion
 - Reliability improvements to goalie sensor Arduino (hardware, software)
 - Added kicker to goalie, and upgraded kicker servo motors
 - Added reflectance sensor under goalie to detect when leaving the goal area
 - Revamped control programs for both robots:
	Goalie uses vision, reflectance sensor, and range sensor to try to stay sensibly positioned when goal-saving
	Attacker has three modes: Seek, Aim, and Shoot, which are activated depending on where the ball is relative to the robot, and what the orientation to the goal and field are.
 - Improvements to vision system
 - Use of EEPROM to save having to recalibrate magnetometer every time
 - Added buzzer for Arduino sensor boards to alert when reset
 - Added battery-low warning indicator circuit
 
Might also be worth trawling the git logs for other things.
