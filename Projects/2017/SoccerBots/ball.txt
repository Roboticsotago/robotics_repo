The Robocup GEN II League Rules specify a HiTechnic IRB1005 pulse IR ball. This will be set in Mode A - RCJ-pulse.

Specification calls for approximately 70 mm diameter (I think the actual IRB1005s are more like 75 mm).

Ball modes available:
	un-modulated mode (continuous)
	"trapezoidal" mode (Robocup Jr, apparently)..not sure what this means
	1200Hz and 600Hz "HiTechnic" modes, for up to 5 m range

Chris will try to borrow a ball for testing...
