Some building blocks for Robot Soccer for Robocup 2017


IR Sensing
Control Systems Theory
	Plants, Feedback
	PID Control
Computer Vision
	Parallel line detection (common vanishing point)
		for orientation, etc.
		need for lens distortion correction?
	Stereoscopic vision and depth perception?
Basic Probability
Bayesian Methods (esp. Naive Bayes/Combined Probability)
State Machines
Signal Processing
	Maybe use Pd for control system?
Neural Networks and other machine learning methods?
Scratch-build a servo motor?
