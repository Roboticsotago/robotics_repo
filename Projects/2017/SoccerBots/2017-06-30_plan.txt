Lesson plan for Friday 2017-06-30

[ ] Unwrap A-B PLC goodies!

[ ] Update on changes to Boris the Goalie to make it work (Sebastian and Chris):
	Replaced USB cable
	Serial port naming issues due to different Arduino Mega board
		Now have separate motor-control-boris.pd
	Calibration mode switch was connected to the wrong pin on the Mega

[ ] Write Tcl replacement for cu
	Should honour signals and respond to Ctrl-C
	Should attempt to reconnect on failure!
	
[ ] Examine Arduino EEPROM use
	[ ] and modify magnetometer code to use it
[ ] Look at general accuracy of the magnetometerand see if we can improve it
[ ] Rethink mounting of main circuit boards. DSpace board is probably fine, but the Pi and Mega could perhaps be improved, ditto the 5 V regulator board.
[ ] Sketch revisions to chassis model for new version to be printed
	Main chassis:
		Enlarge recess for battery connector, not just cable
		Possibly enlarge the whole platform to make room for an additional planetary gear module (4 x 4 x 5 = 80:1 ratio)
			Will need mounting holes to be moved too (perhaps just add a new pair so we can vary)
		Add hole for new "magnetometer set" button
		Add mounting holes for the larger kicker servo mount
		Add mounting holes for the IR platform pillars
		Add mounting holes for power distribution board
		Maybe return to original battery mounting scheme (could lower DSpace board slightly, and would give better strength to main chassis)
	Kicker mount:
		Add recess for battery connector to pass through
	IR platform:
		Maybe reduce size for better directionality, visibility of board when close
	Design mounting for range sensor(s)
[ ] Experiment with rudimentary goalie behaviour
[ ] Test larger servo for kicker? Or wait until the new goalie chassis is ready?

Also:
[ ] PBTech have a sale starting this weekend. Perhaps we can pick up four of those right-angle USB cables.
[ ] Also order some colour sensors from Adafruit?  Any other sensors while we're there?
