Motors and drive train for RescueBot 2017

Considerations:
 - 7.2 V friendly
 - Suitable gear ratio for sufficient speed and torque for obstacles
 - Brushless?  These are quiet and offer high performance.
 - Speed control?  BLDC motors usually need an ESC (electronic speed control) circuit.
 - Two main motors plus castor(s)?
 - Wheel dimensions?

RC540 size is standard for 1/10 scale R/C cars, which would probably be rather big..

Perhaps 280, 360, or 380 size for ours.

	Note that the common Mabuchi FA-130 brushed DC motor has the following specs:
		1.5-3 V
		no-load speed: 12300 RPM @ 3 V (Kv = 4100 RPM/V)
		Stall torque @ 3 V: about 36 g cm (~3.5 mNm)

	For 6-12 V operation, the Pololu #1117 is a much better option! We have a few of these already.

Do we even need servo feedback for drive motors?  Given that the line-following mechanism should be self-correcting, it might not matter too much if the robot veers to one side. Once in the open green space, the vision system could be used to find the can.
	Might be useful to be able to detect current speed, stalling, tipping over, etc., though...

Target speed:

Wheel diameter = say 60 mm (radius = 30 mm)
C = pi * d
  = ~190 mm per revolution

Pololu 100:1 motor runs at about 300 RPM no-load. Stall torque 30 oz-in. 6 V nominal.

300 min^-1 * 190 mm -> m/s
19/20 (exactly 0.95)

So about 1 m/s. Probably fast enough?

Resulting force:

30 ounce * gravity * inch  / (30 mm) -> N
1129848290276167/160000000000000 (approx. 7.061551814226044)

Acceleration (though note that the torque will decrease as speed increases):

F = ma <=> a = F / m

a = 7 N / 400 g (say) = 17.5 m s^-2

Sounds pretty decent...
