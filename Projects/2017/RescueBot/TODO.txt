[ ] Test how frequently an Arduino sketch can read from a digital port and react.
[ ] Obtain colour sensors, test, and integrate
[ ] Range sensing (for water tower, rescue target): ultrasonic or IR?
[ ] Develop and test lifter designs
[ ] Develop a sensor "trolley" design, to keep the sensor distance and orientation consistent with the terrain. Should also provide shielding from ambient light.
[ ] Wireless communication for programming and debugging?
[ ] Test motors and drive trains (Tamiya planetary gear sets? Brushless motors?  Maybe make our own brushless motor controller?!)
[ ] Implement a proportional (and possibly integral/derivative) control system?  Ideally would be able to adapt turning to the curvature of the line.
[ ] Make the system adaptible to different tile surfaces and printing characteristics?
[ ] How to do high-level control?  Subroutines for specialised actions for certain tiles?  Include magnetometer so we can have some sense of direction?
[ ] Computer vision system??? Would need a Raspberry Pi or comparable computer onboard.
