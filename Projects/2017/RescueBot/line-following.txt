Many of the Lego line-following robots seem to suffer from stop-start motion, or have to sway from side-to-side because they only have one sensor.

A robot with at least two sensors should perform much better.  Sebastian's prototype from a couple of years ago should be a good basis, which used three, if I remember correctly.

Tweakable constants:
 - Travel speeds, especially how fast to go when "parallel" with the line.
 - Correction angle 
 - How frequently to check and update the control system. This should factor in the robot's maximum speed and the size of the smallest objects we want to detect.

How to rediscover the line if we lose it?

Line sensors:

We have an 8-unit reflectance sensor already, which uses infrared.  I don't believe it's pulsed IR, however, so it might be somewhat susceptible to interference by sunlight.  Also, the IR LED on the end seems to be broken (you can generally see IR faintly using low-end digital cameras such as on a phone).
