2D plotter/3D printer build, 2017

Do we want the high-temp J350 plastic option (rated to 150 degC)? If we want an enclosed heated build chamber, probably yes.


Selections:
	guide rails:
		NS-01-17-480 x 2 (X axis)
		NS-01-17-350 x 4 (Z axis)
		Y axis could be N series 17 too, or possibly a W profile, vertically oriented (stronger, and easier to mount a small rotary tool or mini spindle motor to)
			Ah, perhaps WSX-10-40 for the Y axis - the integral framing could make for easy construction and good strength. Is there room under the carriage for a 10 mm leadscrew and nut?
		anti-reflex? Oh, maybe that just means non-reflective (black anodised) surface finish? Yes, I think so.
	carriages:
		NW-22-17-30 x 8 (and maybe more for the Y axis)
		preload?
		floating: YZ or just Z
		overmould?
		

	guide rail end caps:
		NSKB-17 (one pair per N series rail)
	leadscrews:
		PTGSG-10X2-01-R (single start, 10 mm diameter, 2 mm lead and pitch)
	nuts:
		flanged with spanner flat?
		JFRM-2525TR10X2 x 2 (or 3)

Igus have some interesting looking bushings and stuff.

These are trapezoidal thread

M3	0.5 mm lead
M4	0.7 mm lead
M5	0.8 mm lead
M6	1.0 mm lead	<- perhaps go with this, for strength and simplicity of maths ("M6x1")

	However, might M6 be too thin to run unsupported over a half-metre distance?  It will be supported by the leadscrew nut, of course, but with the carriage at one end, there will be most of the rail distance unsupported.

	Max length seems to be 1000 mm for most sizes (and 3000 mm for one in particular)

There's also a range of larger trapezoidal thread leadscrews here:
	http://www.igus.co.nz/wpck/3810/DryLin_Trapezgewindespindel

	Smallest diameter is 8 mm, only available with 1.5 mm pitch
	10 mm diameter screw is available with 2 mm or 3 mm pitch.
		CTTOI, 2 mm would be even better WRT simplicity of maths, since we have 200 full steps/rev.  A 2 mm thread would give 0.01 mm/step, which is a nice match for the typical precision of metric G-code and interpreters.
		
		(PTGSG-10X2-01-R is the part number there)
	
	Single-start or two-start thread?
		Multi-start threads allow a longer lead (distance per revolution) for the same pitch (distance between threads of any helix), i.e. faster linear motion for a given rotational motion.

Useful discussion of leadscrew thread here (looks like 2 mm is just right: 8 mm might require too much motor torque and allow being driven by the carriage too easily, but 1 mm is probably excessively fine):

	Screw orientation - left or right?

	1 mm / 200 full steps/rev = 0.005 mm/step
	1 mm / 3200 microsteps/rev = 0.3 micron/step, but remember that microstepping is for smoothness, not accuracy.

Leadscrew nuts:

Required speeds for printing: up to about 80 mm/s would be useful for printing, and 200 mm/s for travel moves.

	80 mm/s * 200 steps/mm = 16 kHz
	200 mm/s * 3200 steps/mm = 640 kHz
	
	Maybe we won't be able to use microstepping then. BBB PRUs can achieve 50 kHz with a 10 us period, but could go much higher (100-200 kHz) without too much trouble, apparently.

	2x microstepping should at least be possible, then, which should help a lot with smoothness. IIRC you get diminishing returns.
	
	For comparison, the CNC machine at home has 400 steps/mm, from 5 mm lead pitch and 10x microstepping, IIRC.  Yep: 200 * 10 / 5 = 400.

	We could work out the specifications another way: start with maximum step frequency, and divide by desired maximum speed (travel or printing), to determine steps/mm, and thereby what degree of microstepping will be possible.

	Say 100 mm/s (6000 mm/min) as the max speed, and 40 kHz as the max step frequency:
	
	40 kHz / (100 mm/s) -> 1/mm
		400

	400 steps/mm.
	
	If we were to up the step frequency to 100 kHz (which MachineKit author Charles Steinkeuhler says is quite achievable):
	100 kHz / (100 mm/s) -> 1/mm
		1000

	So could probably use 1/2 stepping or even 1/4 stepping.
	
	
Maybe use these for the vertical Z axis, and perhaps also the X (long) axis:

What orientation is best for the horizontal rails?

Would we use OpenBeam? IIRC that's about 17 mm, and there's a DryLin NW 17

	I think OpenBeam is actually 15 mm

	What kind of floating element?  Y/Z/YZ?

Oh, they have an example model 3D printer (the BOSON, by NOVA SANDEC, Poland).
	drylin R bearings
	drylin T rails
	drylin E spindle motors

The N series 17 mm rail supports three carriage lengths: 20 mm, 30 mm, 40 mm
	NW-22-17-30 is the 30 mm one

Belt vs leadscrews

I've already pretty much decided to try using leadscrew drive for the plotter/printer, largely because of the positioning accuracy.  On my delta printer at home, artifacts are quite visible on decorative pieces, and high speed (> 200 mm/s) is really not achievable with a narrow nozzle.  If we use LinuxCNC or a derivative (MachineKit), we can control the trade-off between positioning accuracy and feedrate uniformity (using the path-blending settings).
