2D plotter/3D printer build, 2017

Igus have some interesting looking bushings and stuff.

These are trapezoidal thread

M3	0.5 mm lead
M4	0.7 mm lead
M5	0.8 mm lead
M6	1.0 mm lead	<- perhaps go with this, for strength and simplicity of maths ("M6x1")

	Max length seems to be 1000 mm for most sizes (and 3000 mm for one in particular)

	Screw orientation - left or right?

	1 mm / 200 full steps/rev = 0.005 mm/step
	1 mm / 3200 microsteps/rev = 0.3 micron/step, but remember that microstepping is for smoothness, not accuracy.

Required speeds for printing: up to about 80 mm/s would be useful for printing, and 200 mm/s for travel moves.

	80 mm/s * 200 steps/mm = 16 kHz
	200 mm/s * 3200 steps/mm = 40 kHz
	
	Maybe we won't be able to use microstepping then. BBB PRUs can achieve 50 kHz with a 10 us period, but could go much higher (100-200 kHz) without too much trouble, apparently.

	2x microstepping should at least be possible, then, which should help a lot with smoothness. IIRC you get diminishing returns.
	
	For comparison, the CNC machine at home has 400 steps/mm, from 5 mm lead pitch and 10x microstepping, IIRC.  Yep: 200 * 10 / 5 = 400.


Maybe use these for the vertical Z axis:

What orientation is best for the horizontal rails?

Would we use OpenBeam? IIRC that's about 17 mm, and there's a DryLin NW 17

	I think OpenBeam is actually 15 mm

	What kind of floating element?  Y/Z/YZ?

Extra OpenBeam hardware from MakerBeam (if you can't get from MAKERshop):
