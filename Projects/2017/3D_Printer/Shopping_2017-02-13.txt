3D printer shopping, 2017-02-13

[ ] Stepper motors (X, Y, Z, extruder - perhaps heavier-duty for Z and extruder)
[ ] Stepper drivers (DRV8825 probably), X, Y, Z, E
[ ] Framing: OpenBeam?
[ ] Power supply (24 V)
[ ] Bed heater
...

Shop at MAKERshop? They have E3D hot-ends. :)
	Ooh, they stock Mesa cards, too...

Probably a 1.75 mm one. Includes 0.4 mm nozzle.  Might want a larger nozzle as well for faster printing of larger parts.  They go up to 0.8 mm diameter for the 1.75 mm filament.

Ideal motor winding inductance for 24 V power supply:


Stepper motor drivers?  BeBoPr board support Pololu-style carriers, yes?  Go with the DRVs?
	Are we intending to use a BeagleBone (Black)?  What break-out board?

MAKERshop have a variety of NEMA17 stepper motors and drivers, notably a 400 step/rev stepper motor.
