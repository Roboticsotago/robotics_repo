Motion specifications:
	My printer can reasonably print at around 40 mm/s, and non-printing motion around 100 mm/s would be useful.
	As for acceleration, the way this is specified in the firmware config is a bit weird - it's actually a maximum instantaneous velocity change. But it would be good to have a specific number in mind for calculating required motor parameters.

This has some good indicators of speed, acceleration, and also extruder specs, cartesian vs delta:

	Notably, most hot-ends suffer worsening loss of extrusion beyond about 5 mm/s (raw filament?).

	For main XYZ motion, 3000 mm/s/s is pretty standard acceleration for Marlin firmware.
	Igus pre-fabbed motion axes have speeds and accelerations like so:
		DLE-LG-0001 Line Gantry (NEMA 17/23 steper motors):
			Max speed: 1.0 m/s
			Max accel: 3.0 m/s/s
		DLE-FG-0001 Flat Gantry (NEMA 17 stepper motors):
			Max speed: 1.5 m/s
			Max accel: 10 m/s/s
		DLE-RG-0001 (NEMA 23 stepper motors):
			Max speed: 0.5 m/s
			Max accel: 1.5 m/s/s

	Also Part 2 features a great set of engineering calculations:

Stepper motors:
	High torque at low speed
	Peak power at low speed
	Low speed - not really usable above ~1000 RPM
	Simple to operate in open-loop
	Tend to produce juddering motion (can be quite visible on 3D-printed parts)
	Resonance can cause serious positioning problems
	Use microstepping to improve smoothness
	May need to tune drive current

Servo motors:
	High speed (many thousands of RPM)
	Peak power at high speed
	Broad torque range
	More complex closed-loop operation (could use LinuxCNC or dedicated hardware)
	Need to tune PID parameters
	May be more efficient when holding

	Brushed or brushless? I'm leaning towards brushless (electronically-commutated)

	+/- 10 V velocity reference is common..?

Igus materials:
	J is probably fine - no high-load, high-temperature or FDA requirement.

iglideÂ® J:		high efficiency at all speeds 
iglideÂ® L280:	capable of bearing high loads and wear-resistant 
iglideÂ® J350:	for temperatures of up to +302 Â°F 
iglideÂ® R:		the favored option for series manufacturing 
iglideÂ® A180:	FDA-compliant for the food/pharmaceutical industries

	these go up to M6 is thread size and I think look suitable. Perhaps use M6x1 for simplicity of motion calculations..typically 200 steps/rev, so 200 steps/mm.
		If we can get 20 kHz step rate, with no microstepping, that would give 100 mm/s, which I think would be enough.
		
	How to fasten/support the ends? Bearings? How to attach to drive motor?

Hmm, maybe consider their Line Gantry DLE-FG-0001 
	see video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLGYaBPnI28 starting around 6:30
	Hmm, interesting that repeatability on these gantries is only about 0.3-0.5 mm. How come? Would LinuxCNC's backlash compensation help there?
