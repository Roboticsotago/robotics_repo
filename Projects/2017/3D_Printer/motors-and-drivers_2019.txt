Motor and drive options (again) for the 3D printer project

Motor options:
 - plain old stepper motors with open-loop drive
 - hybrid steppers (stepper with encoder)
 - low-cost integrated servo (e.g. Teknic Clearpath)
	(1) digital I/O or switches and buttons (ClearPath-MC), (2) step & direction signals (ClearPath-SD), or (3) software commands from an external Windows or Linux CPU (ClearPath-SC).
		SDSK provides low-noise high-performance, as opposed to SDHP which is optimised for power.

			2310 or 2311? 2311 has somewhat higher power and torque, and is a little more expensive. Both are NEMA 23. Lower power supply voltage will reduce the peak torque available, but not impinge on the continuous torque at least down to 24 V.
			R or E? I think R[egular] is the 800 steps/rev, E[nhanced] is 3200 steps/rev
				R has 0.45 degrees achievable resolution, 0.03 degrees repeatability
				E has 0.057 degrees resolution, 0.03 degrees repeatability
			L or Q? Shaft diameter? L -> 9.525 mm (3/8 inch), Q -> 6.35 mm (1/4 inch)
			N or S? [S]haft seal or [N]o shaft seal?
			
			4000 RPM @ 75 V limit for all of them.
			
 - DIY low-cost servo (ODrive + hobby BLDC motor + encoder)
	https://odriverobotics.com/#odrive
	BLDC motors are fast if low-ish torque, but if we use leadscrews that should compensate.

Control:
 - LinuxCNC in a traditional desktop PC with parallel port
 - LinuxCNC PC with Mesa card
 - LinuxCNC PC with USB control interface
 - MachineKit (LinuxCNC derivative) on BeagleBone Black
	various cape options: https://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Capes
	
		https://elinux.org/Optocape
		BeBoPr variants
		Replicape
		
Drive options:
 - ODrive
	Only two channels!
	Traditional LinuxCNC config uses parallel port and step/direction interface.
	Something like the ODrive would give USB connectivity as an option

Encoder options:
 - rotary opto-encoder on shaft
 - linear opto-encoder a la desktop inkjet printer
 - magnetic linear scale?!

	Note in particular that leadscrews will have an RPM limit, which may only be around 2000 RPM!
