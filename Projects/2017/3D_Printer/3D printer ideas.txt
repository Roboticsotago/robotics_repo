I've been tinkering with my 3D printer over the last few days and have been having some design ideas and wondering about building one with the Mechatronics group this year.  There was also talk last year about making a plotter, which would be a good starting point (only two axes). We could even try to make it convertible between 2D plotter and 3D printer!  My design thoughts:

Problems I've experienced with my own printer:
 - Extruder reliability: grip, strength, damage to filament, skipped steps, ...
 - Extruder hysteresis (Bowden tube slack, connector backlash)
 - Hot-end jams (broken filament, heat migration, retraction)
 - Filament kinking and misfeeding in extruder feeder
 - Belt/pulley failures (fouling with foreign objects, pulley breakage)
 - Resolution limits, rough surface finish (steppers generally move only a fraction of a revolution)
 - Delta calibration complications (many critical dimensions that are hard to measure)
 - Bed-levelling difficulties
 - Thermal problems with printed material: warping (ABS), adhesion, flexibility, heat-buildup and overextrusion
 - Home switch reliability (electrical and mechanical)
 - Blown fuses due to excessive heater current
 - Unreliable electrical connections in temperature sensing wiring, danger of short-circuit in all-metal hot-end
 - Difficult disassembly/disconnection of wiring for servicing
 - Poor bed adhesion (various causes: bed level, bed temp, extruder temp, extruder reliability, type of hairspray, ...)
 - Nuisance changing filament (sprung clamp not finger friendly)
 - Stepper motors skipping under load (both X-Y-Z and E, often due to root cause relating to filament feed or blobby extrusion)
 
Design Ideas:
 - 24 V power supply (linear or switchmode?) for motors, heaters, fans, electronics
 - Cartesian (X-Y-Z) design for simplicity of construction, control, troubleshooting, dual-mode as X-Y plotter, etc.
 - Fixed X-Y plane with lowering Z
	- Allows for direct extruder/hot-end mounting
	- Good rigidity
	- Minimal moving of part during printing
 - Ballscrews for all 3 axes (gear the motors down for better positioning accuracy, run above stepper resonance where possible, sufficient strength to support non-bowden extruder feeder on moving print-head)
 - Possibly servo motors for all the axes (faster and more reliable positioning - necessary with ballscrew gearing)
	although stepper motors might still be very convenient, cheap, and effective, especially at 24 V
 - Heated bed
 - Semi-automatic Z probing capability (for measuring/checking bed levelness and flatness)
	- and/or mechanically adjustable bed height and angle

	Hot-end:
		Ceramic block/heat break?
		Clampable metal mounting for heater cartridge (not grub screw - better contact area)
		
 - Print head position sensing? Laser?
 - Layer quality control (scan to detect lumps): laser?

 - Multi-grip rubber roller extruder
 - Optical sensor for jam detection/avoidance
 
Convertible to X-Y plotter? Removable X-Y module so you can place it on paper or on a drawing table?  Router? Lathe?

Supoprt A3 paper size?
	A0 is defined as having an area of 1 m^2
		xy = 1 m ^2
		y/x = sqrt[2]
		so:
		y = sqrt[2] x
		1 m^2 = x * x * sqrt[2]
		1 m^2 / sqrt[2] = x^2
		x = sqrt[1 m^2/sqrt[2]]
		  = 840.8964152537145 mm
		  
		x = y / sqrt[2]
		1 m^2 = y x y/sqrt[2]
		y^2 = 1 m^2 sqrt[2]
		y = sqrt[1 m^2 sqrt[2]]
		  = 1189.207115002721 mm

	For A3, therefore:
		x = sqrt[1/8 m^2/sqrt[2]] -> mm
		  = 297.30177875068026
		y = sqrt[1/8 m^2 sqrt[2]] -> mm
		  = 420.4482076268573
		
		Or, very roughly, about 500 mm x 300 mm build envelope.
		What about the Z height? Maybe big enough to model a human head?  About 300 mm?

LinuxCNC/MachineKit to drive it?  Will want good customisation.

Axis motion:

Motors will probably be 200 steps/revolution.
Microstepping might have to be fairly low to avoid excessive step frequencies for the controller. Perhaps just 1/2 stepping, so 400 microsteps/revolution.
Small metric ballscrews, perhaps M6x1 (1 mm thread pitch, I guess, so 1 mm per revolution).
So, 400 microsteps/mm.

However, be aware that the stepping frequency of the control electronics is not the only limiting factor: stepper motors suffer reduced torque at higher speeds, to the point where they may have virtually none at around 600 RPM.  This is probably the more significant limiting factor on how fast the machine can run:

600/min * 2 mm -> mm/s
20

That's not really fast enough for 3D printing.

300/min * 10 mm -> mm/s
50

That's probably enough, though wouldn't allow fast travel moves.

Hmm, I remember doing some figuring of suitable leadscrew pitch, and realised for some reason that 1 mm, while it seemed convenient, was actually not a good match.  Ah, was it because there are 200 steps/revolution, and I wanted each step to be a "sensible" size?  Was it 2 mm pitch that I thought would be sensible, then?  That was probably it, giving 0.01 mm per full step (although we'd probably want at least half stepping in practice).

Note that Igus have some lead screws with substantially larger pitch, e.g.
	8 mm diameter, 10 mm pitch

We might actually want to select motors with a larger step angle (fewer steps per revolution) in order to achieve higher speeds.  24 and 48 steps/rev motors are supposedly common, along with 200.

	In general, a motor with many steps/rev will have a lower top speed and poorer torque.

Leadscrew pitch = 2 mm, 200 steps/rev:

2 mm / 200 -> mm
0.01

Hmm, maybe we should actually consider a servo motor system.  If using LinuxCNC, we get that capability for free anyway...

	Stepper motors have high torque at low speeds, but low torque at moderate to high speeds. They cannot reach high rotational speeds.

	But a 3D printer is generally moving at (ideally) a fixed speed of around 30-60 mm/s.  It probably doesn't require a lot of torque, at any speed, although it does need to be able to change velocity, and that means acceleration, which requires a certain amount of force, and therefore torque.

Very interesting demonstration of a Cartesian 3D printer that uses leadscrews:

Also nice improvement to Z axis on Prusa:

Simulation (LinuxCNC on Cyclone):

Set up to print on LinuxCNC:
G53 F1500 X225 Y150 Z0
G92 X0 Y0 Z0

Will be interesting to see what speeds and accelerations are achievable in practice. We want to keep the motion pretty uniform for consistent extrusion. The way RepRap firmwares generally deal with it is to allow the toolpath to "jerk" instantaneously from one velocity to another, within limits.  This is the so-called "jerk" parameter, which is different from the usual meaning in physics/mechanics of the derivative of acceleration. I can't help thinking a better way is LinuxCNC-style path-blending, where you can specify one of:
 - exact toolpath (with the drawback of complete stops at corners and possibly jerky motion on arcs or curves that are actually lines)
 - constant speed (at the expense of positioning accuracy - possibly extreme inaccuracy!)
 - permissible toolpath error (compromise: allow speed reduction to keep within a certain distance of the programmed path)

Extruder hot-end
	I've ordered an E3D V6 1.75 mm
	
	On my home printer, I'm using a 24 V supply for the heaters, and this seems to be OK provided the maximum PWM duty is suitably limited.  I have it limited to about 60/255, and warmup times seem quite acceptable, and I've not had any blown fuses.  It would probably be sensible to measure the actual current drawn to ensure it's within a safe limit.
	
		Apparently such a low-impedance load might cause excessive ripple on the power supply rails, however.
	
	Good info here:

Heated bed

	These are extremely useful. Our bed will be quite large, but at least it's rectangular. Glass should be ?? type.
	
	I think an aluminium heat-spreader would be a good idea, since we probably won't find a single heating pad that is big enough.
	
	Do we have a target temperature/time?
		PLA: ~60 degC
		PET-G: ~75 degC
		ABS: ~100 degC
	
	How to assemble the pad, spreader, and glass bed together?  Especially if we want the base to be somewhat adjustable!  Thermally-insulate underneath?
	
	http://www.makershop.co.nz/Heaters?product_id=291
	200 W (8.3 A @ 24 V), effective resistance: (24 V)^2 / (200 W) -> ohm = 72/25 (exactly 2.88)

BeBoPr++ board?
	12..24 V supply voltage
	16 A input current
	
	Bed heater: max 8 A at 24 V (200 W)
	
	19 V laptop PSU might work, or 24 V switching PSU like my delta's.

Stepper drivers:

	TI DRV8825 might be a nice advance over the traditional Allegro
		8.2..45 V operating voltage
		1.5 A per phase (no heat sink/fan)
		2.2 A per phase (with heat sink and airflow)
		1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 stepping
		fancy waveform stuff

	http://reprap.org/wiki/A4988_vs_DRV8825_Chinese_Stepper_Driver_Boards
	
		Note caution about the value of the sense resistors!  Check on the actual board!
		
		Note issue with using DRV8825 with 1/32 stepping, 24 V supply, and low current limit (<1.5 A)!
	
	Use heatsinks! Drivers will shut down when the die reaches around 150 degC. DO NOT WANT. Note that heat sinks stuck on top may not have much effect - the IC package is designed for heat-sinking through the soldered base!
	
	Sense resistor value Rs is usually 0.1 ohms, and I_TripMax= Vref/(5*Rs)
	Solving for Vref:
		Vref = 5 * Rs * I_TripMax
	So:
		2.5 A -> 1.5 V (max theoretical limit)
		2.2 A -> 1.1 V (recommended limit with heat sink and airflow)
		2.0 A -> 1.0 V
		1.8 A -> 0.9 V (MAKERshop 74 oz-in NEMA17 motor)
		1.5 A -> 0.75 V (Recommended limit without heat sink and airflow)
		1.2 A -> 0.6 V (MAKERshop 35 oz-in NEMA17 motor)

Power:
	+24 V
		Control/Power Board
			Bed heater: max 200 W (8 A @ 24 V)
			Hot-end: 40 W / (24 V) ~= 1.7 A
			Stepper motors: 4 x 1.8 A = 7.2 A worst-case
		Hot-end cooling fan (run at all times! Power directly from PSU?)
