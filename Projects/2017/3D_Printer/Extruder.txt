3D printer build: Extruder options
2019-02-26

The E3D Titan drive looks like a good option:

	Gearing and compact design allows the use of a smaller, lower-torque motor, giving lighter weight, and therefore better acceleration with less oscillation of the end-effector.

	It also should allow good extruder acceleration for retraction.

I really like the main concept of the extruder on Matt's donated Rostock Max, namely using a loop of PTFE tubing to allow the filament to be gripped and driven on both sides of the grip pulley. Even with direct drive (no gearing), it seems to work fine, although we have seen it skip steps at times (usually appropriate times, e.g. loss of heating!).  I wonder what the effect of this is on hysteresis, though...one side seems to drive slightly more strongly than the other, which can cause the tubing to pop off.

	Note that ringing/oscillation can be caused by the stepper motors themselves: the magnetic detent means that they can oscillate fairly freely!

	Stepper motors incur continuous high acceleration (slash "deceleration") forces on the belt. 
	
<<
Idlers, either of the inside or outside type, are not recommended and should not be used except for power takeoff or functional use. When an idler is necessary, it should be on the slack side of the belt. Inside idlers must be grooved, unless their diameters are greater than an equivalent 40-groove pulley. Flat idlers must not be crowned (use edge flanges). Idler diameters must exceed the smallest diameter drive pulley. Idler arc of contact should be held to a minimum.

We obviously have a trade-off between speed and precision. Limiting factors:

 - Maximum motor RPM
 - Maximum step rate of control/drive/motor

Should have design targets for:
 - Maximum speed
 - Acceleration and jerk as well?
 - Positioning precision and accuracy
 

Stepper motors struggle to achieve high rotational speeds, and resonate in nasty ways at low speeds. Tuning the idling current seems to be a fairly unrewarding balancing act. However, they do have decent torque at low RPM, and with low loads, microstepping can be effective in improving resolution.

	Oh, also consider oscillation around corners - stepper motors will be unable to avoid these artifacts.

Microstepping:
 - can improve smoothness and help with resonance problems
 - reduces torque substantially compared to full stepping
 - requires higher frequency step rates

	Also, heat-press threaded inserts for printed parts:

ClearPath? Apparently 4000 RPM is achievable:

X-Y motion for a 3D printer might be up to 100 mm/s, so what gearing are we talking? Doesn't need to be self-locking (though Z axis might).

	100 mm/s / (4000/min) = 1.5 mm/rev
	
	That's pretty close to the available Igus metric M6x1 screw (1 mm thread pitch). Would run a little slow.

Also, what step frequency might be required, an can LinuxCNC on a PC with a parallel port or BeagleBone Black achieve the necessary output? This might be the limiting factor. I know my machine at home can make around 50 kHz. I believe you can choose the encoder resolution for the ClearPath drives.

	Yep: while the internal encoder uses 12,800 counts/rev for the "fractional horsepower" (DC) models, the interface is either 800 steps/rev or 6,400 steps/rev for the "E" (enhanced) models.

What exactly is DrySpin technology?
	I think it refers to the leadscrew profile, which has a curved and asymmetric shape to provide extended lifetime (of the plastic part?), higher efficiency, lower noise, and better vibration dampening.

Ah, Igus have some high-helix screws and nuts in metric style:
	DS12X5
	DS8X10
	
There are also steep-threaded screw options:
	NOTE: high helix thread category may not use DrySpin Technology - check the thread spec
	https://www.igus.com/info/lead-screw-units-nut-high-helix-thread#section_4
	Oh, but quite short max lengths?!
	PTGSG-08x10-R-ES	SG08X10
	PTGSG-08x15-R-ES
	PTGSG-10x12-R-ES
	PTGSG-10x50-R-ES
	PTGSG-12x25-R-ES

But maybe these are a better option:
	https://www.igus.com/info/lead-screw-units-nut-with-camber
	low backlash
	quiet
	mentions 3D printer applications!
		But do we need the self-locking capability? Does that limit screw thread options? And is that feature primarily for dealing with the vertical (Z) axis?
	
	Candidates:
	DST-JFRM-LC-0001-DS8x10	Ds8X10
	DST-JFRM-LC-0001-DS8x15	Ds8X15
	DST-JFRM-LC-0001-DS12X5	Ds12X5
	
	What's the difference between the SG and Ds threads? And what's the code for the ACME/trapezoidal thread? "ACME", apparently.
	
	DST = DrySpin Technology thread? Or is it DrySpin Trapezoidal (for self-locking)?! Or DrySpin Steep Thread?! FFS...
	
	
	And the screws to match would be...?
	
	DST-LS-8x10-R-ES
		DrySpin High Helix, Leadscrew, 8x10 thread, right-handed, stainless steel
		1000 mm max length
		
	

I think we need a spreadsheet of motor and drive options...

	Done! And very helpful, it turns out. The resolution of the ClearPath servos are sort of interleaved with the standard stepper motor options (full stepping, 16x microstepping).
		200 steps/rev for full stepping
		800 steps/rev for ClearPath
		3200 steps/rev for 16x microstepping
		6400 steps/rev for ClearPath E
		
		A ClearPath motor with screw drive, or a ClearPath E with belt drive, should provide the required speed and precision. The belt drive option might have advantages in terms of acceleration, no? However, can it really achieve the specified resolution?

Some nice resources on printing speed limits, particularly hot-end nozzle diameter, heater power.
