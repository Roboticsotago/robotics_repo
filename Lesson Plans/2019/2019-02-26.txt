Let's Talk about Torque...

τ = F x r

	τ (Greek lowercase letter Tau) = torque (SI unit: newton metre, N m)
	F = force (SI unit: newton, N)
	r = radius (SI unit: metre, m)

You can increase torque by applying the force at a greater radius (leverage).

	This is how gears and pulleys work. However, they trade torque for (rotational) speed.
	Also why a spiral staircase is easier to climb than a ladder!
	Other everyday examples:
		Water tap
		Screws, nuts, bolts, wrenches, screwdrivers
		Bottle opener
		Corkscrew
		Crowbar
		Door handle
		Car steering wheel
		Car jack (no-hydraulic)
		Any geared mechanism

Relevant for stepper motor specs, gearing, tightening bolts, cars, ...

	Tightening bolts/machine screws:
		A wrench is a tool that allows you to apply high torque easily.
		Too loose and things could come undone, leak, etc.
		Too tight and you could distort or break the bolt, strip the threads, etc.
		You can get torque wrenches to help get it right.

	A car's transmission usually includes substantial reduction gearing to allow the motor's limited range of useful speeds to be matched to a variety of road speeds. For example, 14:1 between engine and wheels for low gear, 2.5:1 for high gear. If the engine produces say 100 N m torque, that's multiplied by the transmission to 1400 N m it low gear, to 250 N m for high gear.
	
		ICEs have a limited torque and power band. Too slow and they stall, too fast and they will be damaged.
			Torque peaks around 2000-3000 RPM for a typical petrol car engine
			Power is torque times speed, so faster engine speeds develop more power, even if torque drops.
			Peak efficiency (power per unit energy) is usually achieved around peak torque and at high engine load with wide-open throttle. Efficiency drops off at higher speeds due to friction and pumping losses.
				However, usually you don't need that much power! Better economy can be had by driving with low engine speeds and a high gear ratio.
				BTW:
					Fuel efficiency: power output per unit energy input
					Fuel economy: distance travelled per unit energy
					Fuel consumption: fuel consumed per unit time (flow rate)
			Diesel engines provide high torque at low RPMs, often below 2000 RPM.
	
		EVs can get away with minimal/fixed/no gearing due to the very high low-speed torque and broad power band of electric motors.
		
		Some Frink calculations:
		
		tyre_diameter[width is length, aspect_ratio, hub_diameter is length] := hub_diameter + 2 * (width * aspect_ratio)

		For a 185/65R15 tyre:
		
		tyre_radius = tyre_diameter[185 mm, 65 percent, 15 inch] / 2

		100 N m * 15 / tyre_radius -> kN
		6000/1243 (approx. 4.8270313757039425)

		Acceleration would be:
		100 N m * 15 / tyre_radius / (1 tonne) -> gravity
		120000000/243793319 (approx. 0.4922202154358463)
		
			about 0.5 g


In a 3D printer, mechanisms such as pulley and belt convert rotary motion to linear motion. Can solve for F to determine the linear force from the motor torque and effective radius.

A common belt type is the GT2
	Pitch = distance between belt teeth (commonly 2 mm, 3 mm, 5 mm)
	GT2 describes the tooth profile - it DOESN'T mean 2 mm pitch! GT2 and GT3 both come in 2 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm pitch!
	
	10-30 pounds force tension? That'd be 45-133 N - that's guitar-string tension!
	
	I've seen it stated that T = Timing, and G = general (e.g. linear motion). But this says that GT stands for "Gates Tooth":

Super-useful reference here:

http://www.sdp-si.com/PDFS/Technical-Section-Timing.pdf
	Tooth jump torque might be as low as 3 N m under some conditions.
	Max tension: 111 N per inch for 2 mm GT belt
		That's 26 N for a 6 mm belt, or ~2.6 kg x gravity
		That's actually not a whole lot...

Specification also includes the number of teeth (e.g. 16T or GT2-16).

Calculate the effective circumference and effective diameter ("pitch diameter") of the following pulleys:
	20T, 2 mm pitch
	16T, 5 mm pitch
