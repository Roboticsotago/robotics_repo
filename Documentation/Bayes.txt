Bayes for robotics?

Deals with probabilities involving evidence.

Humans are bad with probabilities, and especially bad at probabilities involving prior likelihoods.  We're also bad with logic.

Imagine a statement like "Most robotics engineers speak English".  This means that if you choose a robotics engineer at random, the probability that they speak English is greater than 0.5.

However, this statement certainly does not mean that most English speakers are robotics engineers!  If you chose a random person who speaks English, they almost certainly won't be!  This is because robotics engineers make up only a small proportion of any population.

This is analogous to the inverse proposition in logic:
A -> B does not mean that B -> A

The problem is that many people will hear or read a statistic such as the one above and wrongly conclude that the converse (B->A) is true.

Bayesian statistics and probability allows you to deal with these "conditional probabilities".  Bayesian probability is a nice combination of logic and statistics.

We can write the conditional probability of something as:

p(A|B)

This means "the probability of A, given B".

The Bayes theorem states that:

p(A|B) = p(B|A) x p(A) / p(B)

As you can see, the Bayes theorem lets you "flip around" the conditional probability (like finding B -> A given A -> B), provided you know the independent probabilities of A and B.

Let's work through a example:


We'll make it quantitative by saying that 70% of robotics engineers speak English.  We'll use R and E instead of A and B to make it clearer.

R is the condition of being a robotics engineer.
E is the condition of being an English speaker.
E|R refers to someone being an English speaker given that they are a robotics engineer.
R|E means the condition of someone being a robotics engineer given that they speak English (not the same thing at all as E|R!).

"p(E|R) = 0.7" equates to the statement "70% of robotics engineers speak English"

p(R|E) (the probability of any English speaker being a robotics engineer) is what we are trying to determine.

To work out the probability of a random English speaker being a robotics engineer, we need to know the independent probabilities of someone being (a) a robotics engineer, and (b) an English speaker.

Around 940 million people can speak English globally (though not necessarily as their first language), out of a total world population of 7.4 billion, so the probability p(E) is:

p(E) = 940 million / 7.4 billion
     = 0.13

Let's suppose that 1% of people are robotics engineers (arbitrarily).

p(R) = 0.01

We know already that p(E|R) = 0.7

So, p(R|E) = p(E|R) x p(R) / p(E)
           = 0.7 x 0.01 / 0.13
           = 0.05

In other words, the probability of being a random English speaker being a robotics engineer is 5% - only slightly greater than the probability of any random person being a robotics engineer. It makes sense that this probability is so low, because robotics engineers are generally infrequent/a rare breed.
