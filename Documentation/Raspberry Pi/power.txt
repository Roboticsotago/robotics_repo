Wanting to power my test RPi from a decent 5 V power supply

I have a 3 A one that probably came with my TI DSP dev kit.

I wonder if we want something with an adjustable output...

Maybe a barrel socket with screw terminals, then onto a hacked USB A socket cable, then an ordinary USB A-to-micro-B cable to the Pi.

Might be useful to have a barrel plug with screw terminals as well, in case we need to hack our own power supply.

The rainbow square on the screen is used to indicate low (<4.6 V) voltage.

You can also use the `vcgencmd` to monitor system attributes:

vcgencmd measure_volts core


for id in core sdram_c sdram_i sdram_p ; do
	echo -e "$id:\t$(vcgencmd measure_volts $id)" ;
done

None of these show the input voltage, however.



vcgencmd measure_temp

# Useful for power-saving when roving:

vcgencmd display_power 0

I (Chris) finally got a 2.1 mm DC barrel socket from Jaycar and wired up a USB A socket to that, for testing with the 3 A 5 V supply I have.  So far, so good...
