Decoupling and noise suppression capacitors for DC (and other?) motors

Also:
	Keep wires short
	Keep wires close together (twist!)
	Consider shielding?
	Keep PWM frequency low
	
Place an electrolytic capacitor of a few hundred uF across the power supply going into the motor driver.  On an H-bridge, this should be at the input, not the output, as the capacitors are polarised!

Place a small-value ceramic (low-ESR) capacitor across the input leads of the motor, and perhaps additionally between each input lead and the metal body of the motor.  Ground the motor body, too?

"104" means 100000 pF, or 100 nF, or 0.1 uF.

	This might be a bit large for motor spike/noise suppression, according to Hero999 on electro-tech-online.com, who suggests 1 nF ("102") or 470 pF ("471")
	
	rew agrees: start out with 1 nF ("102"). Large values will cause excessive current spikes from the power supply/driver.

	What about PWM compatibility/interactions?

Voltage rating should be 2..4 times the power supply rating (inductive kickback).  50 V is common, and plenty for a 5 V supply; 100 V also obtainable.

	Those X2Y filters look pretty magical..
