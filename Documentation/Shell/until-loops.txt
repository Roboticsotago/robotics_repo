# Shell script examples of "until" loop for reliability
# The "until" loop construct will run until a condition is met.  Unix commands by convention return a number (return code) indicating whether the program ran successfully or exited because of some error.  To indicate normal success or TRUE, 0 is used (this may seem weird).  Non-zero values can signify various error conditions.

# General form:
# until CONDITION; do COMMANDS; done

# For example, to wait until a network host is reachable before logging in:
# (here, the CONDITION is actually a call to a command, namely "ping -c 1 $HOST", which checks once if the host is responding)

HOST=localhost
until ping -c 1 $HOST; do
  echo Waiting for $HOST to become available...
  sleep 1
done
ssh -Y $HOST

# A simpler version that just tries the ssh command directly:

HOST=localhost
until ssh -Y $HOST; do
  echo .
  sleep 1
done


# Keep trying to run the robot sensor input pipeline:

until ./read_sensors.tcl | pdsend 7000; do
  echo Retrying...
  sleep 1
done
