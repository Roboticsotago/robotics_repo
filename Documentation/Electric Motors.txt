Types of electric motor

Solenoid
	Not a rotary motor, but still a common kind of electromagnetic actuator
	
DC motor
	fixed permanent magnets
	several phase coils on rotor
	often mechanically commutated
	how to make self-starting?

synchronous AC motor

stepper motor
	Technically a kind of AC motor, ...

brushless DC motor
	Essentially an AC motor with integrated electronics.  Often uses a hall sensor to detect the position of the rotor and govern the timing of the coil energisation.

servo motor
	Has built-in feedback (closed-loop) control system to sense where the motor position is and correct for it.

Servo control signals

Vcc for hobby servo motors is, depending on who you ask, 4.8 V, 5.0 V, or 6.0 V.  Hitec spec is 4.8-6 V.  Industrial servos might use much higher voltages.

The control signal for hobby servos is a pulse-width modulation signal (or pulse-duration modulation), with the following timing characteristics:


     |<-------------------->| 20 ms period (or 18 ms?)
      _____                  _____
     |     |                |     |
     |     |                |     |
_____|     |________________|     |____

     |<--->| 1-2 ms pulse width (0.9-21 ms)

With a pulse width of 1 ms, the servo will try to move to the 0 degrees position.
With 2 ms pulse width, the target position is 180 degrees.
At 1.5 ms, the position should be in the middle (90 degrees).
Some servos may have a greater range.  There are also fully rotary servos.

Note that it's the length of the pulses that controls the position, not the duty cycle per se.

The frequency of this control signal is the reciprocal of the period:

f = 1 / (20 ms)
  = 50 Hz

Analog servos typically only drive the motor during the pulse interval, and may benefit from a higher PWM frequency (if supported).

Digital servos do not have this limitation and ofter exhibit higher torque.  Some digital servos are also programmable, allowing the PID parameters to be optimised for the application.

Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)

Widely used in hobby radio-controlled vehicles

Often use back-EMF from the motor to detect rotation, but can also use magnetic (Hall-effect sensors)

Control signal is typically PWM at 50 Hz, the same as for servo motors.  However, quadcopter ESCs often use higher frequencies, such as 400 Hz.

PPM = Pulse Position Modulation

Example: Turnigy Plush 30 A
Has + and - inputs for the DC supply from the battery.
Has three-phase output (A, B, C) for the brushless motor
Has a conventional 3-pin servo-type connector for speed control.  Has a built-in voltage regulator ("Battery Eliminator Circuit" or BEC) supplying 2 A @ 5 V for the radio control receiver.

Example: Exceed-RC Proton-18A
5.6..16.8 V DC in
18 A
5 V 2 A BEC output
