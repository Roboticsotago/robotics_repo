Computer Vision for Info Sci Mechatronics club

There are a variety of image processing and analysis methods that could be useful for projects such as our soccer and rescue robots for 2017.  I'll record a plain list of things here, and explore/explain in separate files...

 - Object recognition (ball, goal, rescue can, features of the playing field, other robots)

 - Lens distortion removal (image warping), for easier recognition of straight (and parallel, perpendicular) lines.

 - Stereoscopic imaging: identifying depth (distance) by comparing two images taken from slightly different vantage points (left and right)
	It might be possible, given the limited features and locations in the soccer field, to use a single camera and infer position and orientation just from 2D analysis of the perspective.
