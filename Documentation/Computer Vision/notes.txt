Computer Vision for Info Sci Mechatronics club

There are a variety of image processing and analysis methods that could be useful for projects such as our soccer and rescue robots for 2017.  I'll record a plain list of things here, and explore/explain in seperate files...

 - Object recognition (ball, goal, rescue can, features of the playing field, other robots)

 - Lens distortion removal (image warping), for easier recognition of straight (and parallel, perpendicular) lines.

 - Stereoscopic imaging: identifying depth (distance) by comparing two images taken from slightly different vantage points (left and right)
