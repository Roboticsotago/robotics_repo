Light and colour

colour as perception of wavelength of EM waves

the visible spectrum (the colours of the rainbow)
	wavelength and frequency
	red is lower frequency (IR/heat is just beyond - harmless)
	blue is higher frequency (UV is just beyond - harmful)

Nice introductory video:

actually a spectral phenomenon (consider incandescent light bulb vs LED or CFL), but our vision system has three main colour sensing elements, each of which cover different regions of the visible spectrum.

Colour of physical objects (selective reflection)

Additive and subtractive colour
	RGB vs CMYK

Short but effective video explaining the RGB colour space, and how it compares to the extent of human vision:

RGB, HSV, HLS, XYZ, etc.
