Light and colour

colour as perception of wavelength of EM waves

the visible spectrum (the colours of the rainbow)
	wavelength and frequency
	red is lower frequency (IR/heat is just beyond - harmless)
	blue is higher frequency (UV is just beyond - harmful)

Nice introductory video:

actually a spectral phenomenon
	consider incandescent light bulb vs LED or CFL)
	our vision system has three main colour sensing elements, each of which cover different regions of the visible spectrum.
	white light has all frequencies in equal amounts, but we could perceive many different spectra as white due to our limited sense
	We use red, green and blue as the additive primaries, but there's nothing "magical" or universal/fundamental about them - they happen to roughly match the sensitivity peaks of our cone types. We often perceive different spectra as the same, e.g. equal intensities of green and red look yellow to us, just as a pure monochromatic yellow (e.g. sodium lamp) would. They stimulate the cones in the same way, so we perceive them identically.

Additive and subtractive colour
	RGB vs CMYK

Short but effective video explaining the RGB colour space, and how it compares to the extent of human vision:

Other colour models/spaces:
	RGB, HSV, HLS, XYZ, CMYK, etc.
