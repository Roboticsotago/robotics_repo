The "standard" scripting language for the ESP8266 NodeMCU boards is a cut-down variant of Lua.

"NodeMCU" can refer the NodeMCU hardware boards, or to the firmware running on the hardware.  The NodeMCU firmware is a modularised set of packages based on eLua (Lua for embedded systems).

You can build customised firmware images based on your required packages here:

In NodeMCU, it is particularly important to avoid using calls that block for any significant time (even 10 ms may be enough to disrupt WiFi communications).  Lua offers an event-based style of programming that is encouraged (possibly mandatory in some cases) for NodeMCU.  Code to be run when an operation completes is registered as a callback function, which will be run asynchronously by the runtime environment.  Other code can run in the meantime.

The reason for this behaviour is that the underlying real-time operating system ("SDK") is non-preemptive and task-driven, and Lua operations are generally implemented as seperate OS-level tasks. The ESP documentation states that if a task runs (not blocks?) for more than 10 ms, system services such as WiFi can fail.

Lua is a dynamic scripting language, in which statements are run immediately and interactively, like in Python or Tcl.
