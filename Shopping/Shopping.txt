Things to buy:

Adafruit:

[ ] Colour sensors
	https://www.adafruit.com/products/1334
		TCS34725
		3/5 V compatible
		NOTE: fixed I2C address
		Integrated IR-blocking filter (should reduce interference from line-following reflectance sensors?)
	How many?  At least 2 for RescueBot, and possibly 3 each for the SoccerBots, so 8 total.  There's a price break at 10, however, so maybe 10 then.
	7.95 USD * 10

[ ] Compass sensors (magnetometers)
	Adafruit again?
	https://www.adafruit.com/products/1746
		HMC5883L
		I2C
		3/5 V compatible
		10 USD each
	How many?  One for each SoccerBot, and maybe one for RescueBot too, and perhaps a spare.  4 in total.
	There's also https://www.adafruit.com/products/1120
		same magnetometer, plus accelerometer
		maybe useful for RescueBot tilt sensing, SoccerBot fall detection, hovercraft?
		15 USD each

[ ] Accelerometer(s) for Peter's balance project
	Maybe use the mag/accel combo for prototyping, since it'll likely be spare

[ ] Adafruit LED display modules with controller backpack?  Henry?


SparkFun:

[ ] Reflectance sensors
	Individual or a bank?  I quite like the 8-way array we have already.
	https://www.pololu.com/product/960
	https://www.adafruit.com/products/2349
	https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9453

[ ] For Music sEMG project: EMG amplifier, battery pack (SparkFun)
	EMG board:
		https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723
		38 USD
	Power shield looks handy:
		https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13684
		4 USD
		Maybe get several, for powering other projects too.
	SEN-11776 is retired
	Get one set for prototyping initially
	One battery pack per EMG board? Each with its own ESP8266?  Or have a wearable harness that shares a (probably bigger) battery pack?  Maybe get one and test, check current draw, etc.
	Get pads elsewhere (cheaper)!


Pololu:
	
[ ] Tamiya 72001 planetary gearbox kit
	https://www.pololu.com/product/70
		16 USD each (need at least a pair, but maybe get one and test it out)
	http://www.rcjaz.co.nz/tamiya-72001-planetary-gear-box-set-p-5811.html
		20 NZD each
	Nice modular design with coaxial output and input shafts, 25:1 ratio available.
		4:1 5:1 16:1 20:1 25:1 80:1 100:1 400:1
	Mabuchi RC-260 motor as standard (NOTE: 3 V nominal!) -> probably want substitutes
		http://www.rctech.net/forum/electric-off-road/238188-380-540-550-720-motor-sizes.html
	Brushed DC motor power band peak tends to be around half the no-load speed. For many motors, it's around 8000 RPM.
	If our target wheel speed is around 250 RPM, that means a gear ratio of about 30:1.
	Lego integration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieF7mHdcZkc

[ ] Tamiya 70145 narrow tyre (pair)
	58 mm diameter
	https://www.pololu.com/product/63
		7.25 USD/pair
	https://www.surplustronics.co.nz/products/5756-tamiya-70145-narrow-tire-set-2-tires
		15 NZD/pair

[ ] Some higher-voltage 180?-size motors (perhaps a pair from Adafruit and a pair from Pololu initially)
	Pololu #1117 model has been pretty good

[ ] Tamiya connectors
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2172 <- Female metal part (device to be powered), need more of these!  At least 5.
		1.5 USD each
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2173 <- Male metal part (battery), have some already
	
[ ] Du Pont style connectors (various)
	https://www.pololu.com/product/1900


Elsewhere:

[ ] Vishay TSOP38240 or TSOP39240 (40 kHz IR receivers - different pin-outs only)
	Adafruit stock the 38 kHz version. At 40 kHz that would probably have about 0.6x sensitivity due to the filter bandwidth.

[ ] Brushless motors + ESCs
	Preferably not TOO expensive!
	380 size? http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__692__691__Cars_Parts-Micro_to_1_18th_Scale_380_Type_.html
	Novak Mongoose Crawler? 18.5T (#3055). ESC has a Servo/Robotic Mode!

[X] Soccer field (MTA?)
	Borrowing one from Sandy

Funding?  Might have to pass a hat around if we want a set of nice brushless motors, controllers, and geartrains.
