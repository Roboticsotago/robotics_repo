Things to buy, late 2016/early 2017:

Adafruit:

[ ] Colour sensors
	https://www.adafruit.com/products/1334
		TCS34725
		3/5 V compatible
		NOTE: fixed I2C address
		Integrated IR-blocking filter (should reduce interference from line-following reflectance sensors?)
	How many?  At least 2 for RescueBot, and possibly 3 each for the SoccerBots, so 8 total.  There's a price break at 10, however, so maybe 10 then.
	7.95 USD * 10

[ ] Compass sensors (magnetometers)
	Adafruit again?
	https://www.adafruit.com/products/1746
		HMC5883L
		I2C
		3/5 V compatible
		10 USD each
	How many?  One for each SoccerBot, and maybe one for RescueBot too, and perhaps a spare.  4 in total.
	There's also https://www.adafruit.com/products/1120
		same magnetometer, plus accelerometer
		maybe useful for RescueBot tilt sensing, SoccerBot fall detection, hovercraft?
		15 USD each

[ ] Accelerometer(s) for Peter's balance project
	Maybe use the mag/accel combo for prototyping, since it'll likely be spare

[ ] Adafruit LED display modules with controller backpack?  Henry?


SparkFun:

[ ] Reflectance sensors
	Individual or a bank?  I quite like the 8-way array we have already.
	https://www.pololu.com/product/960
	https://www.adafruit.com/products/2349
	https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9453

[ ] For Music sEMG project: EMG amplifier, battery pack (SparkFun)
	EMG board:
		https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723
		38 USD
	Power shield looks handy:
		https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13684
		4 USD
		Maybe get several, for powering other projects too.
	SEN-11776 is retired
	Get one set for prototyping initially
	One battery pack per EMG board? Each with its own ESP8266?  Or have a wearable harness that shares a (probably bigger) battery pack?  Maybe get one and test, check current draw, etc.
	Get pads elsewhere (cheaper)!


Pololu:
	
[Y] Tamiya 72001 planetary gearbox kit
	https://www.pololu.com/product/70
		16 USD each (need at least a pair, but maybe get one and test it out)
	http://www.rcjaz.co.nz/tamiya-72001-planetary-gear-box-set-p-5811.html
		20 NZD each
		Actually based in Hong Kong?
	Nice modular design with coaxial output and input shafts, 25:1 ratio available.
		4:1 5:1 16:1 20:1 25:1 80:1 100:1 400:1
	Mabuchi RC-260 motor as standard (NOTE: 3 V nominal!) -> probably want substitutes
		https://www.pololu.com/file/download/rc_260rasa.pdf?file_id=0J15
			Shaft diameter: 2.0 mm
			Body diameter: 23.8 mm (~24 mm, 2nn size)
			Mounting bulkhead diameter: 19.0 mm
			Front hole spacing: 11.5 mm
		http://www.rctech.net/forum/electric-off-road/238188-380-540-550-720-motor-sizes.html
	Brushed DC motor power band peak tends to be around half the no-load speed. For many motors, it's around 8000 RPM.
	If our target wheel speed is around 250 RPM, that means a gear ratio of about 30:1.
	Lego integration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieF7mHdcZkc
	
	For the Tamiya robot tyres, 8k RPM, 1:25 gearing, we get about 1 m/s speed (ignoring friction losses)
	8000/min / 25 * 58 mm * pi = 0.97179932751044270828 m s^-1 (velocity)
	
	Higher-voltage replacement motors?
		The planetary gearbox comes with a Mabuchi RC-260 motor, whereas other Tamiya kits using that size have the Mabuchi RE-260
			RC-260	0.4 W .. 20 W, 4.5 V nominal
			RE-260	0.4 W .. 4.0 W, 1.5 V or 3 V nominal

			Limiting current might be very sensible.  Not sure we can do that with the standard L260n chips, but you can use say a DRV8825 to drive DC motors as well, apparently.
			
			Maybe we'll end up with an Arduino/RAMPS for the motor control!
			
			Apparently it's an RC-260SA-2295 (10k RPM no-load, 13 mN m stall torque, ~2 W)
			http://www.robotshop.com/forum/help-problem-powering-tamiya-rc-260-motors-t9466
			
			R = V / (P / V) = ~10 ohm effective
			Normal current (peak efficiency): I = P / V = 0.44 A
			Perhaps limit to 0.5 A
			0.5 A * 7.2 V = 3.6 W
			

[Y] Tamiya 70145 narrow tyre (pair)
	58 mm diameter
	https://www.pololu.com/product/63
		7.25 USD/pair
	https://www.surplustronics.co.nz/products/5756-tamiya-70145-narrow-tire-set-2-tires
		15 NZD/pair

[Y] Some higher-voltage 180?-size motors (perhaps a pair from Adafruit and a pair from Pololu initially)
	Pololu #1117 model has been pretty good

[Y] Tamiya connectors
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2172 <- Female metal part (device to be powered), need more of these!  At least 5.
		1.5 USD each
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2173 <- Male metal part (battery), have some already
	
[Y] Du Pont style connectors (various)
	https://www.pololu.com/product/1900

[ ] Servo motor for kicker mechanism
	https://www.pololu.com/product/1055/specs
		out of stock!
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2142/specs
		smaller, less powerful

[Y] Step-down DC-DC converter (for the main drive motors, any servos, the Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
	Total current requirement:
		3 A for the Pi + camera
		3 A for the two main motors combined
		1.5 A for the kicker servo
		Probably need the 9 A one then!  The 15 A model would be overkill, though.
				
[ ] Stepper motor drivers/carriers
	or get from MAKERshop?
	DRV8825 (2.5 A per-phase output, 8.2 V .. 45 V supply, 1/32 stepping)
	DRV8833 (1.2 A continuous, 2 A peak, 2.7 V .. 10.8 V)
	DRV8835 ()
	or might we get a BBB break-out board that has onboard drivers?

[ ] Caster/castor/idler wheels?

Elsewhere:

[ ] Vishay TSOP38240 or TSOP39240 (40 kHz IR receivers - different pin-outs only)
	Adafruit stock the 38 kHz version. At 40 kHz that would probably have about 0.6x sensitivity due to the filter bandwidth.

[ ] Brushless motors + ESCs
	Preferably not TOO expensive!
	380 size? http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__692__691__Cars_Parts-Micro_to_1_18th_Scale_380_Type_.html
	Novak Mongoose Crawler? 18.5T (#3055). ESC has a Servo/Robotic Mode!

	Castle Creations Mamba:

		http://www.castlecreations.com/products-search?qs=Mamba
		
[X] Soccer field (MTA?)
	Borrowing one from Sandy

Funding?  Might have to pass a hat around if we want a set of nice brushless motors, controllers, and geartrains.
