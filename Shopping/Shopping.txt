[ ] Tamiya 72001 planetary gearbox kit
	Nice modular design with coaxial output and input shafts, 25:1 ratio available.
		4:1 5:1 16:1 20:1 25:1 80:1 100:1 400:1
	Mabuchi RC-260 motor as standard
	Brushed DC motor power band peak tends to be around half the no-load speed. For many motors, it's around 8000 RPM.
	If our target wheel speed is around 250 RPM, that means a gear ratio of about 30:1.

[ ] Tamiya 70145 narrow tyre (pair)
	58 mm diameter

[ ] Some higher-voltage 180?-size motors (perhaps a pair from Adafruit and a pair from Pololu initially)
	Pololu #1117 model has been pretty good

[ ] Tamiya connectors
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2173 <- Female (device to be powered)
	https://www.pololu.com/product/2172 <- Male (battery)
	
[ ] Du Pont style connectors
	https://www.pololu.com/product/1900
	
[ ] Soccer field (MTA?)
	Sandy may have a spare one at the moment that Columba was borrowing

Funding?  Might have to pass a hat around if we want a set of nice brushless motors, controllers, and geartrains.
